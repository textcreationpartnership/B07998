            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> is ſo glorious in your Challenge, and your <hi>Grand Imposture</hi> proclaimes it ſelfe ſo inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, that iealous of my owne inhability, I feared I might repent my courage, if I entertained the Combat. But from my <hi>Weaknes</hi> I drew <hi>Confidence,</hi> and called to memory, how ſmall an arme confounded the proud boaſt of the huge <hi>Philistian;</hi> and by how childiſh a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he was hurled downe to what he built on, earth; and forc't to acknowledge himſelfe duſt, and vanity.</p>
            <p>Take not therfore your owne height by the Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that Title you beare, or Reputation of your much learning, which is your Guilt, not Ornament. Nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me by my humble <hi>Vocation,</hi> for I haue vowed to be ambitious of no higher; or by the obſcurity of my <hi>Name,</hi> ſince I can eaſily forgiue the preſent Age, if it know me not; and Poſterity, if it forget, I was. Neither had I now entred into this publike Quarrell, had not your bold defiance to all of my profeſſion prouoked me to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how little integrity there is, where it is moſt vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. At firſt, a pious Curioſity laboured only my owne Satisfaction: That it now appeares abroad, is the Charity I owe my Countrey: And that it ſwells to this Volume, is the fault of your many, and I feare, too wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Conſider, my Lord, how many ſoules are imbarked with yours; for whoſe wrack at the laſt day you muſt ſtand accomptant. And though a pleaſing gale hath blowne gently on you, yet no wind but driues you on towards Iudgment. There the ſincerity of action, not the fallacy of language ſhal preuaile: there no enforced Argument, falſe Citation, or cunning Diſtinction ſhal be able to iuſtify Vntruth. There hereſy ſhall ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
<pb facs="tcp:181297:3"/>and they who maintained it (rackt by their owne Conſciences) cry out; Behold where the Saints are enthroned in glory, raiſed thither by Humility, &amp; Obedience to the authority of that <hi>Church,</hi> which if <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelfe ſpeake truth, is <hi>Infallible;</hi> by reſignation of theirs to the diuine will, and cooperating to the merits of the great Mediator: But we mad men made a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of their wiſdome; &amp; to take the blemiſh from our looſe behauiour, diſcredited the value of good works: We preſumptuous in the vanity of Wit, oppoſed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Truth; and to deſtroy the Monarchy of <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; his Succeſſors, proclaimed liberty to euery Rebellious Doctrine: We liſtened to the ſuggeſtions of a priuat Spirit; and ſeduced by that, contemned a long recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and vniuerſall Verity: and therfore iuſtly now is our portion darkneſſe, and our inheritance eternal fire.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but the holy Spirit often whiſpers theſe thoughts into your ſoule: but Pride keeps the gate of the hart faſt ſhut. Moreouer if we looke not ſtreight on heauen, without ſquinting on temporall reſpects; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering your fat reuenue, and your Lordſhip, I may well be thought to inuite you to your loſſe. But who, that hath regard to Safety, deſpiſeth not the flatteries of Wealth, and Honour, when he meditates on the Treaſures of the Eternall? And why ſhold I vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, though you haue erred willfully, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Mercy may reclaime you; if ignorantly, that when you heere find how much your iudgment hath betraied you, you will penitently ſubmit, and make much ſatisfaction by your great example?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. Augustine</hi> thought it no diſhonour to his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be ouercome by <hi>Truth,</hi> and rather then looſe a Soule, forſooke an Hereſy; which, as all others, had an
<pb facs="tcp:181297:4"/>age to floriſh in. Nor is his Humility, a ſcandall to his Learning, or was his Change, Inconſtancy: whoſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes carry that reputation, that euen Sectaries, who want his vertue for Obedience, endeauour to wreſt his doctrine, for Defence. Here may your Lo? learne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: whom to accompany in an humble Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will be more ſafety and glory, then to perſeuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in a proud miſtake. If the cunning, and art of your many Writings enamour you, throw away the vnhappy dotage, though in them Hope flatters you, that your memory may hereafter liue. Safer far, to haue no Name with the ſucceeding Age, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it in the infamy of a ſpurious Iſſue. And belieue it, when the Soule wilfully imbraceth Errour, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the worſt Adultery; what-euer is ingendred by ſuch conceptions, being both illegitimate, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous.</p>
            <p>Looke vpon the opinions of them, who liue ſeuered (if they can be ſaid to liue who are dead to grace) from the Vnity of the Church; and confeſſe, how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Errour is to it ſelfe. That Innocency from Luſt, which ſo many of your Writers affirme impoſſible to preſerue, your owne ſingle, and (I hope) incorrupt life hath approued poſſible: for vnleſſe you will endanger your ſelfe to a Cenſure in the high Commiſſion, you muſt acknowledge, <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> may be kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> But what diſcouers the bodies of all Churches, which oppoſe the Catholike, moſt miſsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen is the diuiſion among your ſelues; now and euer ſo apparent, that I dare confidently auerre, were there a Councell called of all thoſe you reckon yours, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe might ſuſpend his Cenſure, each one of you prepar'd to pronounce the other, <hi>Heretike.</hi> And for
<pb facs="tcp:181297:4"/>your Lo.<hi rend="sup">p</hi>, though reputed moſt Orthodoxall, vnleſſe you quit that moſt reuerend Title, which is your honor to make good, I ſuſpect, you would by the <hi>Maior</hi> voyce be condemned, without the guilt of any other crime: though Truth and all Antiquity teach vs, that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall dignity hath euer bene moſt eminent, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Church, and ought to be held in veneration, where lawfully conferred, not vſurped.</p>
            <p>But I feare, I keep no good time, when I ſtrike on this harſh ſtring: I will not therfore further afflict your eare. Let me only intreat, and if poſſible, preuaile with your Lo.<hi rend="sup">p</hi>, to caſt vp the accompt of thoſe many yeares you haue numbred heere on earth. And if you haue prouided a Marble hereafter to incloſe your duſt, looke not on the flattering Epitaph, which betrayes the Reader: but liſten to the ſilent ſad Oratory, in which it pleads to you your condition. It tells you, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry path of life, how crooked ſoeuer in mans purpoſes, leads ſtreight to death: That all the pompe of wealth, and honour (for acquiſition of which he doubts not often to ſtake a Soule) is but an euening ſhadow, ſoone to be loſt in an euerlaſting darkneſſe: That youth doth oftentimes breake promiſe, when it propoſeth length of life; but that age is frantick, if it hope long to hold out againſt the aſſault of death.</p>
            <p>It therfore imports your Lo.<hi rend="sup">p</hi>, who oppreſt with yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res bow downward to the graue, ſeriouſly to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp; turne your ſight fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe vanities which haue hitherto bewicht you. For pardon me, if to pride &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity I aſcribe a long continuance in error: and that I want credulity to thinke, an able Scholler can belieue Vntruth, though for the deſignes of his owne Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he obtrude it to the world.

            <p>The Author of the <hi>Grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> in his first Epistle dedicated to his Maiesty, ſets only forth in generall the heads of that doctrine he afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors (though vnluckily) to make good. But Error without apparence of proofe, confutes it ſelfe: And it would anticipate the deſigne of my study, if here I should labor thy ſatisfaction; ſince the whole enſuing Treatiſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers euery of his miſtakes in particuler, which at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to his Booke, he affirmes in groſſe. Yet could I wish, that only truth should dare to approach the throne of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; and that a conſcience guilty of deceipt, should not be able to pretend the confidence of the innocent: for the falſest do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may eaſily winne beliefe vpon the Laity, whom either much buſines diuerts from the ſearch of truth, or an vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſse to be disturbed, encourageth to follow that eaſy path, they from their infancy haue beaten; eſpecially when it appeares in publike aſſeuered by them who haue their large ſtipend, and high honor, only on condition to be ſincere in
<pb facs="tcp:181297:6"/>what they teach. But howeuer he may flatter himſelfe that hs Reader will neuer arriue to patience inough, to trauaile beyond his Epistles, or that his authority will be ſufficient, though his proofes are defectiue; I hope he will find his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to haue betrayd him: for the buſineſſe which here we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouert, being of value far beyond the whole world beſide, I meane the ſoule of man, and the Church, in which only that can expect ſafety; I doubt not <hi>(good Reader)</hi> but thou wilt be ſo charitable to thy ſelfe, as to reade, distinguish, and then reiect error, how plauſible ſoeuer it may appeare to ſenſe: Nor, though his reputation may haue gained heretofore much vpon thee, wilt thou belieue, that Truth is by couenant bound to christen all the abortiues of his Opinion.</p>
            <p>And wheras in his ſecond Epistle, directed to all Romish Priests, whether Ieſuits or others, he ſeemes by a Rhethoricall figure, to heare them cenſuring his charging the Church of Rome with <hi>Impoſture, the bold aſſumption, or rather impudent, and impious preſumption of an Heretike;</hi> I cannot but commend the iudgment he instructs them to pronounce: for how could the wit of Iustice inuent a more proper, or ſeuerer? Or to ſpeake more truly, how could Mercy vſe a gentler? And though in that ſingle word, <hi>Heretike,</hi> all Impiety is comprehended; yet how can he deſerue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſentence, who hath dared to defame thy innocency, O thou Immaculate Spouſe of our great Redeemer? Who hath termed thy doctrine, which threw downe the Statues of the Heathens, and rooted vp all falſe worship, <hi>Idolatrous, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious?</hi> Thy doctrine, which planted the fayth of Christ with the bloud of Martyrs, and tyed vp the common enemy of man, <hi>Satanicall, and Antichriſtian?</hi> Thy doctrine, which is the only ſafety of the ſoule, <hi>Execrable, and Pernicious?</hi> which teacheth the true adoration of God, <hi>Blaſphemous &amp; Impious?</hi> which neuer varied in the least article from the
<pb facs="tcp:181297:6"/>truth, <hi>Schiſmaticall, and Hereticall?</hi> But how farre vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are theſe weake calumnies to wound thy strength, which hath triumpht ouer all the oppoſition of hereſy, and hell? Thou art built vpon a Rock of Diamond, which yields the brightest lustre, when impure ſlander raifeth the blackest night: A Rock, which neuer moued ſince Chriſt deſigned it, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his greatest worke on earth: A rock, against which her many Aduerſaries haue battered with continuall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, but still ended in froth, and noiſe.</p>
            <p>But all theſe fowle aſperſions might be interpreted the wild expreſsions of an extrauagant zeale, and perhaps challenge that pitty we throw away vpon the franticke. Neither can any man be enraged with ſuch infamous language, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, it is that ſpirit, which poſſest the firſt profeſsors of this pretended reformation; who created a Religion in contempt of iuriſdiction. And as euery where they derogated from the ſpirituall, ſo ſpared they not the temporall, where feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment restraind not their tongues to modesty.</p>
            <p>But what euen amazeth my Vnderstanding, is, that ſo well practis'd a man in controuerſy, ſo iealous of honor, and ſuch a pretender to integrity, should fall into that deceitfull, and, I may ſay, fatall crime of the writers of his Coate, falſe citation, and miſinterpretation of Authors. What iniury hath he done the dead, whoſe ſoules are bleſſed in heauen, and whoſe ashes are reuerenced on earth, to make them defend a doctrine, in oppoſition to which they emptied euery veine in their most (acred bodies? What cruelty to the liuing, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended obedience to the authority of the primitiue times, to inforce them to belieue the errors of the preſent? Doth he hope, his Volumes shall fall only into the hands of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or els of the negligent, ſo far, that any doctrine shall poſſe for currant, which his fancy hath bene pleaſed to coyne? Did he intrust others to make ſcrutiny into Authors for his
<pb facs="tcp:181297:7"/>purpoſe, &amp; ſo aduenture his reputation to the world, on an vncertaine, and perhaps vnfaythfull euidence? Or did he belieue, according to the rule of the worst Stateſmen, any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation how iniurious ſoeuer, most iust, if it ſerued the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his deſigne? For certainly he hath giuen the world an example of ſuch a courage, that no good Writer will euer follow, in daring thus to be diſproued by any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who hath the benefit of a Library, and the patience to compare truth with falſhood. For without giuing credit to the testimonies I here alleage, if any man will ſearch into the Authors themſelues, he ſhall find them mangled, as that<note n="(*)" place="margin">Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſtes apud Plutarch, in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeo.</note> Tyrant did his ghests (who with most barbarous torment ſhortned or lengthned their bodies, according to the proportion of his bed:) No man writes short of his ſenſe, but is extended on the rack: no man beyond, but is mutilated without mercy.</p>
            <p>This diſcouery of his vnhappy practiſe I wiſh may beget his conuerſion, not confuſion. But ſhould he be ſo enamoured on his error, as not to be remoued by the most forcible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Truth; I hope <hi>(Reader)</hi> in thee to reape ſome fruit of my labor. The Almighty in distribution of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, will not be directed by humane iudgment. Let his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſdome therfore beſtow the fruit of my ſtudy, where, &amp; on whom he pleaſeth: for to his glory I must conſecrate that, with whatſoeuer I am.</p>
            <p>Only <hi>(Curious Reader)</hi> I must beg thy pardon, that in endeauouring to write buſines, I haue neglected language, which like that muſick Poets aſcribe to the Syrens, hath bene often treacherous to the hearer. Elegancy of ſpeach is a gift, in which the wicked share equally with the good: and the most ſacred tongue that euer ſpake, diſdained to adulterate truth with any fallacy of an artificiall Phraſe. The policy of ſome Republikes hath expeld their Orators, as ſubiects whom the power of eloquence rendred formidable; the multitude being
<pb facs="tcp:181297:7"/>eaſy to receaue any impreſsion through the eare; and Oratory being a weapon as sharpe to destroy, as defend the State. Nor doe I value the cunning of language worthy the induſtry of the ſerious: It may be of conſequence, where well directed; but truth needs not borrow any ornament of language, to make it ſelfe more amiable. That which I aime at, is thy ſatisfaction; and that the Church of God, which is on earth no other, but the Roman, may shine vnclouded in the ſight of men, as it hath euer bene most pure in the eye of God. And that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind whom error hath miſled, may re-vnite themſelues into her fayth; guided by which, the innocent can only hope for perſeurance to glory, and the repentant a way to mercy.</p>

                  <p>For the better vnderſtanding of this, we are to conſider ſeuerall dignities vnited in the perſon of the Biſhop of Rome. He is Biſhop, Arch-biſhop, Patriarke, and Pope. As he is Biſhop, his iuriſdiction is confined to the Citty of Rome, and other townes within her territories, of which the Roman Dioces conſiſteth. As he is Archbiſhop, he hath ſubiect vnto him ſome few others, the chiefeſt of which, is the Biſhop of <hi>Ostia.</hi> As he is Patriarke, the extent of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is ouer all the Weſterne, or Latin Church.

And the ſame I proue by examples. For when we ſpeake of the Iewiſh people, or the Iewiſh Church, we vnderſtand not the tribe of Iuda only, but all the reſt of the tribes, that were ioyned therwith. <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was of the tribe of Leui; <hi>S. Paul</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Beniamin;</hi> and that holy widow <hi>Anna,</hi> mentioned by <hi>S. Luke</hi>

Likewiſe vnder the name of the Greeke Church, are not comprehended the naturall Greeks only; for the <hi>Muſcouits</hi> and <hi>Ruſsians,</hi> though they be of a different nation, and haue their ſeruice in a different tongue, are yet eſteemed, and ſaid to be of the Greeke Church, becauſe they imbrace her Doctrine, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And what more vſual to Proteſtants themſelues, then to call Catholikes in what parte of the world ſoeuer they liue, <hi>Romaniſts?</hi> And laſtly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme this manner of ſpeach with ſecular, aſwell as with Eccleſiaſticall examples, who knoweth not, that according to the phraſe of all writers, by the name of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> is not vnderſtood the Citty and territories of Rome only, but alſo whatſoeuer other Prouinces ſubiect to the Roman Emperors, though neuer ſo diſtant from Rome? And ſo in like manner, when we ſay, that <hi>out of the Roman Church there is no hope of ſaluation,</hi> by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> we vnderſtand not the particuler Dioces of Rome, but all the Churches of the world, which make one Catholike or vniuerſall Church, of which the Roman is head, and the reſt members ſubiect to her. And becauſe the Biſhop of Rome is head of all Biſhops, the particuler Church of the Roman Dioces is the mother and miſtreſſe of all Churches: In regard whereof ſhe may in a ſenſe not improper, be called <hi>the Catholike Church:</hi> as in a fleete of

Be it, that the Catholike Church mentioned in the Creed taken in her whole latitude, comprehendeth both the militant and the triumphant; yet in your argument you miſtake the ſtate of the queſtion: for when we declare the Catholike Church to be the Roman Church, we ſpeake not of her taken in her whole latitude, but only as ſhe is militant.

True it is, that all members of the Church are not alike: thoſe that with fayth haue ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiing grace (which is the life of our ſoules) are liuing mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: they that haue fayth without grace, are according to diuers opinions tearmed diuerſly: ſome ſay, they are dead <hi>members:</hi> ſome, that (becauſe they are dead) they are not <hi>members</hi> properly, but improperly or equiuocally, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather to be called <hi>partes of the Church,</hi> then <hi>members.</hi> Others ſay, that they are neither members, nor partes, but as ſuperfluous or corrupt humors in the body of man.</p>
                  <p>Theſe opinions though they differ in words, yet they agree in this, that fayth being the eſſentiall forme of the Church, all the faythfull (be they Saints, or ſinners, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinat or reprobat) are contained in the precincts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, euen as all, whether members, parts, or humors of man are contained in the body of man. And as for this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of ſpeach, Turrecremata, Canus, and others cited by them, and here alleaged by you out of Bellarmine (for out of him you tooke them) call ſinners, <hi>partes of the Church,</hi> and not <hi>members, but only equiuocally,</hi> becauſe (as Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez rightly<note n="(*)" place="margin">De trip. virtute Theol. p. <hi>1.</hi> d. <hi>9.</hi> n. <hi>12.</hi>

Peter was ordained by Chriſt Paſtor of his whole flocke; and therefore Gouernor of the vniuerſall Church: from whence it followeth, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, or other faythfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Church of Chriſt, after S.

Peter as yet had not made choyce of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeate, as afterwards he did at Antioch: and therfore the Church of Antioch whiles he ſate there, was the Head and Mother Church, to whom all other Churches were bound to profeſſe vnion and obedience. In regard wherof, that Holy Pope Innocentius the firſt, greatly commended by S. Auguſtine,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Epist. <hi>18.</hi> Alexand. Epiſc.

To haue ſpoken to the purpoſe, you ſhold haue proued, that the Saints which departed this life, before the Roman Church was founded, were ſeparated from the communion of S.

                  <p>YOur ſixth Argument is a mere ſophiſme. Al Catholike Diuines accord, as in a matter of fayth, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or vniuerſall Church<note n="(c)" place="margin">

Peter. Secondly, and that the Roman Church, whiles the Succeſſors of S. Peter continue their ſeate at Rome, cannot fayle in fayth. But that S. Peter fixed his ſeat at Rome by the commandement of Chriſt, there to remaine to the end of his life, and in his Succeſſors to the end of the world, although it be a moſt pious and probable opinion, held by the greateſt and beſt part of Diuines, yet it is not expreſſe matter of Fayth, becauſe no ſuch precept of Chriſt appeareth in Scripture or tradition: and therfore ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines ſtick not to grant that the fixing of S. Peters See at Rome, was a thing proceeding merely from his owne free will, and election; &amp; conſequently, that it is in the power of his Succeſſors to tranſport it from Rome to Antioch, or any other City. In which caſe, as Rome ſhold not then be the See of S. Peter, but Antioch: ſo neither ſhould the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome be the ſupreme Gouernor of the whole Church, nor the Church of Rome the Catholike Church, as the Head and miſtreſſe of all others (as now ſhe is) but Antioch: Nor ſhould ſhe then haue any priuiledge of not erring in fayth, as now Antioch hath not, ſince the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of S.

Peter, or whiles hereafter ſhe ſhall remaine the See of S. Peter, may erre in fayth, is to argue <hi>à ſenſu diuiſo ad ſenſum compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum,</hi> and to infer that ſuch things as perhaps are poſſible, but neuer ſhall be, are already in being. If I ſhould argue
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:181297:42"/>thus. It may poſſibly come to paſſe (though it be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) that the Metropolitan See of England may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from Canterbury to Carlile: Ergo the Church of Canterbury is not now the Metropolitan Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: were not this a ſophiſme? And ſo is yours. Some of our Diuines grant that the See of S. Peter which maketh the Church of Rome the Mother &amp; Miſtreſſe of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſecureth her from all error in fayth, may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Rome, though there appeare no likelihood ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Ergo (inferre you) in the opinion of ſome of your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, the now Roman Church is not the Miſtreſſe and mother Church of the world, but may now fall from the fayth, euen whiles ſhe is the See of S.

And to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry you ioyne fraud: for, to proue that the Succeſſor of S.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:181297:47"/>without ignorance and falſehood: for you ſet downe this acknowledgment in a different character, as the words of Baronius and Suarez, which yet are not theirs, nor of any of the other authors, whom you name, but your owne fiction. They indeed acknowledge, that Ioſeph of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia came into Brittany: but that his coming was the 35. yeare of Chriſt, before S. Peter founded either the Church of Rome, or of Antioch, is your addition falſly impoſed on them. For though according to the computation of Baronius, Lazarus with his ſiſters Mary and Martha were driuen out of Hieruſalem in the 35. yeare of Chriſt, and together with Ioſeph of Arimathia (by the prouidence of God) came to Marſils in France; yet nether Baronius nor Suarez, nor any one of the authors ancient or moderne, which you obiect, ſayth, that Ioſeph planted that yeare a Church in Brittaine. You name Gildas; but he neither mentioneth Ioſeph of Arimathia, nor ſaith, that Chriſtian religion was planted in Brittaine in the tyme of Tiberius Caeſar, as you by miſplacing his words, make him ſay, but ſpeaketh of the great calamities and deſolation of that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, cauſed by the warres which the Romans made vpon the Brittans, not in the tyme of Tiberius, nor of Caius (for in their tymes the Romans had no warres with the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans) but of Claudius; in the third yeare of whoſe Empire, thoſe warres began, and continued 40. yeares togeather, vntill the tyme of Domitian. <hi>Interea</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the meane tyme</hi> (ſayth<note n="(y)" place="margin">In epiſt. de excidia Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. c. <hi>6.</hi>

               <p>By all which it appeares, that the Brittiſh Church was not firſt founded by Ioſeph of Arimathia, the 35. yeare of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:181297:48"/>Chriſt in the raigne of Tiberius, but by S. Peter in the time of Claudius, after he had founded the Church of Rome, &amp; placed his ſeat there; and conſequently that the Church of Rome is moſt truly and properly Mother of the Church of Brittaine, not only by reaſon of the ſecond conuerſion of our nation by Fugatius and Damianus ſent by Eleutherius the 13. Pope after S. Peter; and alſo of the third conuerſion by S. Auguſtine, and his companions, ſent by S. Gregory the Great (whom therfore Bede calleth the Apoſtle of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland) but alſo in reſpect of the firſt preaching, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a Chriſtian Church in this Iland, it hauing bene wrought by S. Peter his diſciples, &amp; other Roman Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians cooperating therto. And ſo much the more if it be true, that S. Paul aſſiſted S.

               <p>As for Ioſeph of Arimathia his comming into England, I grant it to be true, though it be not affirmed by any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writer, but only by Capgrauius, Polydore Virgil, &amp; other late hiſtorians. Tradition is ſufficient to confirme me in the beliefe therof. Yet withall it is certain, that he came not the yeare of Chriſt 35. (as you without any proofe at all ſuppoſe) but hauing come out of Iury into France, with S. Mary Magdalen, and her company, after he had liued there ſometime, and ſeene her great auſterity of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue and ſolitary life, and rigor of pennance which ſhe vſed, went ouer into Brittaine, either ſent by S. Peter, or by his owne free election. And though it be likely that by preaching the Ghoſpell, he increaſed the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Brittiſh Church, yet the chiefe intention of his comming was, to begin that kind of ſolitary and heremiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call life, which he had ſeene practiſed by S.

               </p>
               <p>From hence it followeth, that the Roman Church is Mother to that of Brittaine, not only by reaſon of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent

And ſo likewiſe it is in our caſe: for as theſe two propoſitions, <hi>The fayth of Peter walked on the waters,</hi> and, <hi>Peter walked on the waters,</hi> are both true, but in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſenſe; for the fayth of Peter walked on them cauſally, as being the cauſe why Peter walked: and the perſon of Peter walked on them truly, properly, and formally. So likewiſe are theſe two both iointly true, though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſenſe: <hi>The Church is built vpon the perſon of Peter;</hi> and, <hi>The Church is built on the fayth or confeſsion of Peter;</hi> becauſe the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Peters fayth &amp; confeſſion was the cauſe which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Chriſt to chooſe Peter for the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of his Church, rather then any of the other Apoſtles: &amp; to that end he gaue him the name and ſolidity of a Rock, that the gates of hell might neuer preuaile againſt the Church built on him.</p>
               <p>In like manner when S. Auguſtine and other expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors teach, that Chriſt is the Rock or foundation on which the Church is built, their expoſition differeth not from the former in ſubſtance, but only in manner of ſpeach: for (as Salmeron<note n="(h)" place="margin">Tom. <hi>4.</hi> part. <hi>3.</hi> Tract. <hi>2.</hi>

                  </note> haue well obſerued) their meaning cannot be, that the Rock on which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:181297:50"/>to build his Church for the future, is his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, formally conſidered as in himſelfe, both becauſe on him, it was already built from the tyme of his incarnation; as alſo becauſe he ſpeaketh not to himſelfe, but to Peter, ſaying, <hi>Thou art Peter &amp;c.</hi> And therefore as when in the words immediatly preceding, he called Peter by his owne name <hi>Simon the Sonne of Iohn,</hi> he ſpake to Peter in particular; ſo likewiſe he did when immediatly he added: <hi>and I ſay to thee, that thou art Peter</hi> (that is a Rock) <hi>and vpon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> And the ſame is yet made more euident by other profes which Bellarmine<note n="(k)" place="margin">L. <hi>1</hi> de Pont. c. <hi>10.</hi> §. Primo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomen.</note> alleageth. Wherfore the ſenſe is, that Chriſt promiſeth to build his Church on himſelfe, <hi>obiectiuely,</hi> that is to ſay, as confeſſed by Peter: which expoſition differeth not from the former, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſly deliuered by S. Ambroſe<note n="(l)" place="margin">In c. <hi>3.1.</hi> ad Cor.</note> in theſe words: <hi>The true and approued ſenſe is, that the Church is built by God vpon Chriſt, but yet as confeſſed by Peter, and not by any other: which is as if it were ſaid, vpon thee confeſsing Chriſt, and vpon the confeſsion which Peter made of Chriſt, or vpon Chriſt confeſsed by Peter.</hi> So S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe: and ſo alſo S. Auguſtine ſaying<note n="(m)" place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. c. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note>: <hi>Afterwards I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thus, theſe words of our Lord, Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rock I will build my Church, that it should be vnderſtood to be built vpon him whom Peter confeſſed, ſaying, thou art Christ &amp;c.</hi> And that by this expoſition S. Auguſtine intendeth not to deny the Rock meant by Chriſt in thoſe words, to be S. Peter, is a truth that may not be denyed: both becauſe in that very place he ſayth, that, <hi>This ſenſe is celebrated by many in the verſes of S. Ambroſe ſaying, The Cock crowing, the Rock of the Church washed out his offence;</hi> as alſo, becauſe he there affirmeth, that in other places of his workes he had expounded thoſe words not of Chriſt, but of Peter (as the reſt of the Fathers do) which expoſition he recalleth not, but leaueth to the readers diſcretion, to chooſe which of the two, he liketh beſt. <hi>Let the reader choſe</hi> (ſayth he)<note n="(n)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>which of theſe two ſenſes is the more probable.</hi> From whence it muſt needes follow, that albeit he doubted, whether of thoſe two ſenſes agreeth beſt to the words of Chriſt in that place, yet of the truth to the thing it ſelfe, to wit, that, <hi>Peter is the Rock on which Christ
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:181297:51"/>built his Church,</hi> he neuer doubted. If he had thought that to be a falſe ſenſe, he had done very abſurdly, in not recalling it, but leauing to the readers choyce, to follow eyther that, or the other: for it had bene to leaue it in his choyce, to follow a true ſenſe, or a falſe, an orthodoxe verity, or an hereticall error: which though you do, yet none but ſuch as you, will preſume S. Auguſtine to haue done.</p>
               <p>By this it appeares, that all thoſe teſtimonies of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Popes, and other authors, which you (to make a floriſh) heap vp in the foure firſt Sections of your fourth Chapter, to proue that the Rock on which Chriſt promiſed to build his Church, is not Peter, but the Confeſſion of Peter, or Chriſt (for either of both will ſerue your turne, ſo that Peter be excluded) are impertinently alleaged: for the meaning of them is, that the Church is not built vpon Peter, meerely, as he was a weake man, and abſtracting from his confeſſion of Chriſt; but vpon him, as confeſſing Chriſt, and for his confeſſion, and in reward therof. And ſo likewiſe it is built vpon Chriſt, not excluding Peters confeſſion, but vpon him as confeſſed by Peter. All which is euident out of thoſe very Fathers and expoſitors which you produce for the contrary: For they ſo fully, and ſo vnanſwerably auouch Peter to be the Rock on which Chriſt built his Church, and you ſo certainly know it to be true, that much againſt your will you are inforced vpon the rack of truth to confeſſe ſo much, though you do it mincingly, ſaying:<note n="(o)" place="margin">

                  <hi>It is out of doubt, and notorious to all ages, that the holy and most bleſsed Peter Prince and Head of the Apoſtles, pillar of the fayth and foundation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, receaued from Ieſus Christ our Lord, our Sauiour, &amp; redeemer of mankind, the keyes of the heauenly kingdome, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the power of binding and loſing which he had receaued, and that in his Succeſsors he ſtill liueth vntill this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the particulars in which he exerciſed his power, are expreſſed in holy Scripture. We read in the Acts of the Apoſtles,<note n="(i)" place="margin">Cap. <hi>1.15.</hi> &amp; ſeqq.</note> that immediatly after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, Peter riſing vp, propoſed to the brethren the ſubſtituting of an other Apoſtle inſteed of Iudas, exerciſing his authority therin. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſayth S.

                  <hi>riſing vp in the middeſt of the Diſciples, ſaid</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold how feruent Peter is: how he owneth the flock committed to him by Chriſt; how he sheweth himſelfe Prince of this aſsembly. See likewiſe the modesty of Iames: he had bene made Bishop of Hieruſalem, and yet ſayth not a word. Conſider alſo the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular modeſty of the other Diſciples, how they yeld the throne to Peter, not debating for it among themſelues, as formerly they had done.</hi> And further ſhewing, how Peter in this affayre exerciſed his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority before, and aboue the reſt, he ſayth:<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Why doth he communicate this buſineſſe with them? might he not haue made the election alone? He might without doubt but did not, leſt he might ſeeme partiall to any.</hi> And againe:<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>This was the wiſdome and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of this Doctor: He ſaid not, We alone are ſufficient to teach: and although he had right to appoint an Apoſtle, as much as all they had, yet this doing it with aduice, was agreeable to the Vertue of the man. And becauſe eminency in ſpiritual power is not an honor, but a care of ſubiects, yet worthily doth he firſt before them all, exerciſe authority in the buſines, qui omnes habebat in manu, who had all the rest at his diſpoſition, and will: for this is he, to whom our Lord ſayd; And thou being conuerted confirme thy brethren.</hi> So Chryſoſtome.

Nor did any of them make reply to Peters words; but preſently at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they appointed two whom they thought worthieſt of that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that God himſelfe might deſigne one of them.</hi> Can any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike at this day more fully, or in more ſignificant words expreſſe the exerciſe of S.

               <p>Syr, the Apoſtles being guided by the holy Ghoſt, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no humane Canons, nor conſtitutions for their owne direction. But for the direction of all ecclefiaſticall Paſtors they made Eccleſiaſticall Canons, which S. Peter as their Head, confirmed, and deliuered by word of mouth to S. Clement his Diſciple, and Succeſſor in the Roman See: &amp; he committing them to writing left them to poſterity as Canons of the Apoſtles. I know, that your Magdeburgian Centuriſts cauil againſt them, as falſe, &amp; ſuppoſitious: but withall I know, that diuers of thoſe Canons are alleaged by many ancient Fathers, by many Councells, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by later Canons of the Church, and inſerted word by word into them, as Franciſcus Turrianus hath learnedly demonſtrated (x),<note n="(y)" place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> pro Canon.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:181297:64"/>to himſelfe, to wit, of admitting any out of the Dioces of another, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing thoſe that are excommunicated by another, of Canonizing Saints, of confirming Synods, of granting plenary Indulgences</hi> &amp;c. Who ſeeth not the futility of theſe obiections? For firſt the Apoſtles being confirmed in grace, neither did, nor could wrong their ſubiects: in which caſe only Appeales are lawfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I haue already ſhewed<note n="(a)" place="margin">Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that the reſolution of that great caſe concerning the obſeruation of the law of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, was reſerued to S. Peter; and that he reſolued the ſame in the Synod of Hieruſalem, preſiding in it: and when the Pope perſonally preſideth in a Councell, there needeth no other confirmation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When Chriſt made Peter Head of his whole Church, he gaue him power to bind &amp; loſe throughout the whole world, and therby power to excommunicate delinquents in whatſoeuer Dioces of other Biſhops; and likewiſe to abſolue them from the guilt of ſinne, in the Sacrament of pennance, as alſo to binde by excommunication, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue from the ſame: and finally to releaſe the penalty due to ſinnes by Indulgences, out of the Sacrament: for the power of binding and loſing which he gaue to Peter, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited not to the Sacrament of Penance only. But whether Peter exerciſed this power of excommunicating and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning by indulgences, we know not; for all his actions are not written. We know, that S. Paul did excommunicat the inceſtuous Corinthian<note n="(b)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</note>, and afterwards when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, at the interceſſion of Timothy, &amp; Titus, (as Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret<note n="(c)" place="margin">

Nor is it to be doubted, but that S. Peter (who as ordinary Paſtor had power ouer the whole Church) did exerciſe the ſame power, if the like occaſion were offered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In thoſe primitiue times the Canonization of Saints was not performed with ſo great ſolemnity, nor with ſuch exact inquiry into all particulars, nor with the depoſition of ſo many witneſſes, as in theſe later ages it is. If then the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:181297:65"/>Church did with vnanimous conſent, reuerence any one that had died for Chriſt (as the Martyrs did) or that liued &amp; died holily (as did the Confeſſors,) he was by publike voyce and conſent of the Church reuerenced as a Saint, (the See Apoſtolike either expreſly, or taci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of S.

For who ſeeth not that Nazianzen acknowledgeth a far greater dignity in Peter, then in Iohn, or any other of the Apoſtles, when he ſayth that, <hi>Christ called Peter a Rock, and committed to his charge the foundations of the Church?</hi> for that is to ſay, that he made him Head, and Gouernor therof, it being a knowne truth, that the foundation in a building, is the ſame that the Head in a politicall body: from whence it is, that the famous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Chalcedon<note n="(x)" place="margin">

               <p>The third teſtimony which Bellarmine alleageth of S.

And we may vnderstand it not to be ſpoken of the Apostles only, but of all the faythfull that shall be till the end of the world.</hi> Which addition of Theophilact ſheweth, that this priuiledge giuen to Peter of not failing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:181297:74"/>in fayth, and confirming his brethren, was not perſonall, but belonging to his office, and deſcending with it to his Succeſſors: for Peter in his owne perſon, was not to liue till the end of the world; and therfore not by himſelfe, but by his Succeſſors, to confirme the faythfull vntill the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>The ſame truth is further proued out of an ancient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe intituled, <hi>A diſpute between the Church and the Synagogue,</hi> written by a learned Author, aboue 700. yeares ſince, in which it is ſaid<note n="(d)" place="margin">

And what, I beſeech you, are we to thinke him to haue ſignified to vs, but that, that Church eſpecially whoſe Bishop Peter (the Head of all Churches after Chriſt) was to be shold alwayes remaine in the confeſsion of one true fayth.</hi> To theſe I adde the teſtimony of Georgius Trapezuntius a learned Grecian, who explicating the ſame words of Chriſt, ſayth<note n="(*)" place="margin">In illud Ioan.

He ſaid,</hi> Once, <hi>to shew that the Apoſtles being confirmed with the grace of the Holy Ghoſt none of them should erre; but that their Succeſsors should; for whoſe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation Peter, that is to ſay his Succeſſors, are commanded to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted; which hath byn effectually performed: for the reſt of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world haue byn often confirmed by the Roman, but She ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by others.</hi>

If it be true, that he named Iames before Peter, he did it not to equall them in authority, and much leſſe to preferre Iames before Peter, but in regard of the priority of the knowledge which Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes receaued of the great grace giuen to Paul: for when he came the firſt tyme to Hieruſalem to giue the Apoſtles no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his calling, and of the great fruit of his labors, he found none of them there but Iames. Put now the like caſe, and it will neither be ill manners, nor any derogation to the Popes authority to name him after the Biſhop of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, or of Milan. 4. Becauſe it is certaine, that in all other places of the new Teſtament, in which there is a Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of all the Apoſtles in generall, or of ſome in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Peter is ſtill named in the firſt place: and if here (as you ſay) he is named before Peter, becauſe he was Biſhop of Hieruſalem, it is no argument to proue him Superior or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in authority to Peter.

And this publike fame was of great moment for the conuerſion of other nations: for Rome being the Head of the world, whither all ſorts of people vnder that vaſt Empyre had recourſe for diſcharg of their tributes, and accompts of their offices, they cold not but haue knowledge that the Romans belieued in Chriſt. And (as Tolet noteth out of S.

                  <p>To your ſecond Argument I might anſwere with 8. Chryſoſtome, that they which were but a ſmall number newly conuerted, and weake, S. Paul ſalutes them by the name of a Church, to comfort them; but not thoſe, that were more in number, and of longer ſtanding, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were, when he writ vnto them. For this reaſon I ſay, that as S.

                     <hi>S.

                        </gap>de,</hi> which words containe a moſt notorious falſification: for he returnes not to this, which you make the firſt, by leauing out <hi>ſecundò,</hi> but to the firſt of the three, which you neuer mention. And wheras he ſayth, that the firſt ſolution is in his iudgment the more ſolide, you by falſifying, apply this his ſaying to the ſecond; againſt which becauſe you can make a ſhift to cauill, you would haue your reader thinke it is Salmerons firſt ſolution, and that he thought it to be the moſt ſolide of all the three.</p>
                  <p>But of what import to your cauſe is this iugling? Marry, that becauſe in the ſecond ſolution Salmeron mentioneth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:181297:93"/>the factions that were then in Rome betweene the Iewes and Gentiles, you may inferre, that S. Paul did thinke Rome to be (as other Churches) ſubiect to the alteration of Schiſmes and factions: and in proofe therof you ſay,<note n="(u)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 69.</note> that, <hi>not only our Profeſſors among themſelues, but alſo Popes and Antipopes were diſtracted into diuers Schiſmes, and factions &amp;c. One of our deuout Doctors reckoning the number of theſe Schiſmes to haue ben twenty; an other accounting the continuance of one of them to haue endured fifty yeares.</hi> Our Deuout Doctor whom you mention to proue that there hath ben twenty ſchiſmes in the Roman Church, is Stapleton. The place in which you cite him is his thirteenth booke, <hi>De princip. Doctrin. Cap.</hi> 15. wheras in that worke he hath but twelue bookes in all. But be it, that there haue ben twenty Schiſmes in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church: Schiſme is not a ſinne againſt fayth, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Charity. If then Antipopes or other profeſſors of the Roman Church haue broken the bond of charity, was it therfore lawfull for you to renounce the fayth of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church? If Schiſmes be a lawfull cauſe of departure, who can ſtay in your Proteſtant congregation, diuided &amp; ſubdiuided into Lutherans, Caluiniſts, Zwinglians, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wniſts and a thouſand other Sects vnder theſe? new ones daily ariſing among you, as Separatiſts and Socinians, all which are diuided not only in poynt of charity, but in the very ſubſtance of fayth.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely you are ill aduiſed to obiect the Schiſmes of the Roman Church in iuſtification of your departure from her: for ſince (as our Authors haue aduertiſed) nether the perſecutions of heathen Emperors, nor the Gothes and Vandals, nor the Turke, nor any ſacks, or maſſacres by Alaricus, Genſericus Attila, Borbon, and others, nor the emulation of ſecular Princes, (were they Kings or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors) nor the many Schiſmes and diuiſions betweene the lawfull Popes and Antipopes, nor the manifold difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; dangers in their elections, nor the great vices which haue bene noted in ſome of their perſons, nor any ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, haue had power to ouerthrow the Roman Church, as they haue done the Churches of the Eaſt, and many of the

But your Ieſuits Ribera and Viegas both of them Spanish Doctors and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike profeſsors do confidently auerre the contrary: and the one is ſo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:181297:96"/>bold as to hold him to be a moſt notable foole that shall deny it.</hi> But good Sir, by your leaue, this is a moſt notable vntruth. That which Ribera ſayth, is, that towards the end of the world, Rome ſhall be burned, not only for her former ſinnes of Idolatry, and perſecuting of Chriſt, vnder the Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, but alſo for other ſinnes, that in the end of the world ſhe ſhall commit vnder Pagan Kings: and that this is ſo certaine out of the Apocalypſe, that no man, though neuer ſo fooliſh, can deny it. This Ribera ſayth: and it may well be ſaid, that he who out of theſe words of Ribera in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth (as you do) that the City of Rome is to be the ſeat of Antichriſt, or that Ribera ſayth ſo, is, I will not ſay, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table foole, but whether he deſerue not that name, I leaue to the readers cenſure.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of Ribera, Viegas, &amp; the Rhemiſts is, that when S. Iohn calleth Rome, <hi>Babylon,</hi> he neither ſpeaketh of the Church, or Pope of Rome, nor yet of the Citty of Rome, as ſhe is vnder the gouerment of Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or in obedience of the See Apoſtolike: for in that eſtate, <hi>the hath</hi> (ſayth S.

And though you ſet downe the third, yet it is in your Latin Margent only, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from Suarez his context, that the reader will not eaſily vnderſtand the force therof.

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 78. 79.</note> Suarez opinion is, that S. Iohn ſuruiuing S. Peter, was ſubiect to Linus his Succeſſor, ergo, <hi>S.

                     </note> addeth much more of the ſame kind, out of S.

                  <p>I conclude therfore with Doctor Sanders, <hi>that he which readeth all theſe particulars, and more of the ſame kinde that are to be found in the workes of S.

But becauſe here you inſiſt ſo much theron, I will for the readers ſatisfaction briefly declare, in what ſenſe Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, and S. Gregory refuſed that title, and how to better
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:181297:117"/>your argument, you abuſe, and falſify our Authors.</p>
                  <p>The title of <hi>Vniuerſalis Epiſcopus, Vniuerſall Bishop,</hi> may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two wayes: firſt for a Biſhop, that challengeth an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall power ouer all other Biſhops, clayming to himſelfe a right of hearing, and determing all Eccleſiaſticall cauſes in his owne, and their Dioceſſes, leauing them no other right to exerciſe any Epiſcopall iuriſdiction &amp; power, but only ſuch as they ſhall receaue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him as his Vicars. In this ſenſe S.

And in this ſenſe he calleth the name of <hi>vniuerſall Bishop, A prophane and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian title.</hi> 2. It may be taken in the ſame ſignification with <hi>Epiſcopus Vniuerſalis Eccleſiae,</hi> ſo, that it ſignify a Biſhop to whom belongeth the gouerment of the vniuerſall Church and the determining of all ſuch cauſes as appertaine to her in generall, without taking away, or hindering the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power and right of other Biſhops, and leauing each of them in their ſeuerall places &amp; degrees with full power and authority to iudge and determine all Cauſes Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall belonging to their Dioceſſes, and within them. In this ſenſe the tytle of <hi>Vniuerſall Bishop</hi> is not condemned by S.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:181297:117"/>therby he might better repreſſe his inſolency.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine is deliuered by Baronius and Bellarmine, of whom (becauſe they declare <hi>Vniuerſalis Epiſcopus</hi> in this ſecond ſenſe to be all one with <hi>Epiſcopus Vniuerſalis Eccleſiae</hi>) you ſay<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 94.</note>: <hi>They would gladly confound theſe two titles, therby to proue their Popes to be proper Monarkes ouer the whole Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome predeceſſors of S. Gregory haue bene called Bishops of the vniuerſall Church, which is their peruerſe error refuted by one of their learned Ieſuits.</hi> But you muſt pardon me, if I tell you, that this is a ſhamefull vntruth: for Baronius and Bellarmine deliuer the ſame double acception of <hi>Vniuerſalis Epiſcopus,</hi> which I haue declared; and likewiſe affirme, that in one of them it may be attributed to the Pope, but not in the other: which is not to confound, but to diſtinguiſh, that confuſion and miſtake may be auoyded. And the thing it ſelfe is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: for if the title of <hi>Vniuerſalis Epiſcopus</hi> might not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a ſenſe vnlawfull, S. Gregory would not haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it in Iohn of Conſtantinople, as <hi>a new, prophane, &amp; Antichriſtian title.</hi> And againe, if it might not be taken in a ſenſe lawfull, neither the Councell of Chalcedon, nor the following Fathers<note n="(h)" place="margin">Apud S. Greg. l. <hi>4.</hi> ep. <hi>36.</hi>
                     </note> would haue giuen it to the Biſhops of Rome. The former ſenſe is vnlawfull becauſe it taketh away all ordinary power and iuriſdiction due to other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in their Dioceſſes. The ſecond is lawfull, becauſe it leaueth to them their ordinary power and iuriſdiction. From whence it followeth, that as S. Gregory in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſenſe did inſtile himſelfe <hi>Epiſcopum Vniuerſalis Eccleſiae;</hi>
                     <note n="(i)" place="margin">Ep. ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Epiſcop.</note> ſo if <hi>Vniuerſalis Epiſcopus</hi> be taken in the ſame ſenſe, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lawfull, and due to the Biſhops of Rome: and in this ſenſe he taketh it when he ſayth, that the Councell of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon and the following Fathers gaue it to his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. But the former ſenſe he condemned as prophane and Antichriſtian, &amp; reprehended in Iohn of Conſtantinople.</p>
                  <p>And Salmeron (for it is he whom you call the learned Ieſuit) is ſo far from refuting this double ſenſe of <hi>Vniuerſalis Epiſcopus</hi> deliuered by Baronius and Bellarmine, that in the very place which you nominate<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tom.</hi> 12. <hi>Tract.</hi> 78.</note> he expreſly deliuereth the ſame: but you (to make good your word) falſily him:

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 94.</note> 
                     <hi>he confeſſeth that a Bishop of the vniuerſall Church, is one, that hath care of the whole Church, which terme may agree to euery Bishop.</hi> This cannot be excuſed from an vntruth: for Salmerons words are: <hi>Epiſcopus Vniuerſalis Eccleſia is eſt, qui vacat curae &amp; regimini Vniuerſa Eccleſia: at Epiſcopus Vniuerſalis eſt, qui ſolus omnibus praeest, omnia curare vult. He is Bishop of the vniuerſall Church that hath the care and gouerment of the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church:</hi> by which words Salmeron rightly proueth that which is auerred by the two Cardinals, to wit, that as the Popes before S. Gregory were ſtiled <hi>Bishops of the Vniuerſall Church,</hi> ſo they had not only a charitable care, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to euery Biſhop, and to euery lay man, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but alſo the gouerment of the whole Church, which by vertue of their office of ſupreme Paſtors belonged vnto them. This explication of Salmeron you cannot diſgeſt: &amp; therfore though you ſet downe truly part of his Latin words in your margent, yet in your Engliſh of them you fraudulently leaue out <hi>regimini, gouerment,</hi> to perſuade your readers (which either vnderſtand not or els ſeldome looke into your Latin margents) that the ancient Popes had not the gouerment of the whole Church, but only a charitable care of her good, ſuch as euery Biſhop, &amp; lay man is bound to haue.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus falſified Salmeron, you do as much for Platina, whoſe words you ſet downe thus<note n="(m)" place="margin">

                     <hi>the authority of Conſtantine, I ſay, that in all thoſe doctrines which concerne the nature of God, there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant teſtimomes in Scripture, out of which if they be rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, we may be fully and plainly instructed; but the true ſenſe of the Scriptures dependeth on the vnwritten tradition of the Church. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame Theodoret that reporteth this ſpeach of Constantine, declareth in the next Chapter, that in the Councell of Nice Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res were produced on both ſydes, but the Arians were not conuinced with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they expounded them otherwiſe then the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and therfore were condemned by the vnwritten tradition of the Church piouſly vnderſtood: to which condemnation no man euer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that Constantine aſſented.</hi> So Bellarmine. And hereby it appeares, that when you ſay, <hi>Bellarmine citeth Theodoret, &amp; yet (as the Steward in the Ghoſpell) iniuſtly concealeth that which followeth in him,</hi> namely, that the greater part of the Councell obeyed the voyce of Conſtantine, you wrong Bellarmine, and a buſe Theodoret, who in thoſe words relateth not to the determining of controuerſies by Scriptures, but to Conſtantines exhortation made to the Biſhops of peace, and concord among themſelues, which
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:181297:131"/>(ſayth Theodoret) <hi>the greateſt part of the Councell obeyed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing mutuall concord, and true doctrine,</hi> though diuers Arians diſagreed, ſome of whoſe names he there expreſſeth. This you iniuſtly conceale, like the ill Steward in the Ghoſpell, that you may pick a quarrell with Bellarmine. In confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this I might adde, that (as S.

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Whether the ſixth Councell condemned Honorius Pope, as an Heretike.</head>
                  <p>THeſe paſſages of the ſixth Councell ſo forcible for the authority of the Roman Church, you mention not, but paſſing by them, as being not for your purpoſe, pick out of it a quarrell againſt Honorius B. of Rome, &amp; that with no ſmall lack of ſyncerity: for wheras you obiect out of Bellarmine, that in this ſixth Councell, as alſo in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, and eight, Honorius was condemned as a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelite, Bellarmine contrarily proueth out of Honorius his expreſſe words, that he was no way guilty of that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, but alwayes a Catholike, holding with the Roman Church two wils and operations in Chriſt. And he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſame with the teſtimony of S. Maximus Martyr, the greateſt Diuine of that age, and that liued in Honorius his tyme. And Maximus himſelfe in a famous diſputation which he had with Pyrrhus Patriarke of Conſtantinople, alleageth as witneſſe of this truth Honorius his owne Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, that writ thoſe epiſtles dictated from his mouth, and was then ſtill liuing. Wherfore Bellarmine denyeth that the ſixth Councel damned Honorius, as an Hereticke; and further proueth it, becauſe Agatho in his firſt epiſtle to Conſtantine the Emperor, which was read in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and not only read, but approued, and admired as the words of S. Peter, and as dictated by the holy Ghoſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth expresſly, that none of his Predeceſſors (one of which was Honorius) was euer guilty of hereſy, but that they haue alwayes made reſiſtance to heretikes, &amp; that the Pope, as Pope, cannot decree any thing contrary to fayth. And from thence he inferreth, that the Councell did not iudge Honorius to be an heretike, nor condemne him as ſuch: els by receauing and reuerencing Agathos Epiſtle, as <hi>the words of S. Peter, and as dictated by the holy Ghost,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſhould contradict it ſelfe, and condemne both S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:181297:163"/>and the holy Ghoſt of a lye, in affirming that none of Agatho's predeceſſors was euer guilty of hereſy. And the truth hereof he confirmeth by the teſtimony of Nicolas the firſt, who in his epiſtle to Michael the Emperor, auoucheth, that, <hi>none of his predeceſsors was euer ſtayned with the leaſt ſpot, or blemish of hereſy,</hi> which he wold not euen for very ſhame haue affirmed ſo reſolutely, if Honorius in the publike aſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly of a generall Councell had bene anathematized as an heretike.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore Bellarmine rightly inferreth, that Honorius was not condemned by the ſixth Councell, but his name inſerted among thoſe heretikes whom the Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by the Greekes, enemies to the Church of Rome. And ſo it is teſtified by Theophanes Iſaurus a Greeke hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and out of him by Anaſtaſius Bibliothecarius: which alſo he confirmeth, becauſe it was the frequent and almoſt ordinary cuſtome of the Greekes, to corrupt, and falſify Bookes in hatred of the Roman Church, and in fauor of their owne errors.

                     </note> obſerueth, teſtifiing that Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias Pope hauing tranſlated that worke of S.

Againe Nicolas the firſt remitteth Michaell the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to the Epiſtle of Adrian, <hi>if</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>it be not falſified after the manner of the Graecians, but kept by the Church of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, as it was ſent by the See Apoſtolike.</hi> And he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay ſo: for what he alleageth to Photius, out of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians Epiſtle to Tharaſius, is not to be found in that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as it is read in the eight Synod. And finally this very ſixth Councell diſcouered, that the Greekes had falſified the fifth Councell generall, fathering on Pope Vigilius, and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:181297:163"/>Menas Patriarke of Conſtantinople, certaine quaternions of their owne.</p>
                  <p>If then they haue falſified the writings of the Fathers of the third, the fourth, the fifth, and eight generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells; what maruell if they haue done the like to the ſixth, and ſeauenth, defaining Honorius? and eſpecially, ſince a little after the ſixth Councell, they aſſembled themſelues againe at Conſtantinople, by their owne authority, and made the Trullan Canons, in hatred of the Roman Church.</p>
                  <p>To this I adde, that in the Lateran Councell of 105. Biſhops, held before the ſixth Synod, by Martin the firſt Pope and Martyr, againſt the Monothelites, Sergius, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Pyrrhus, and Paul were condemned by name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of Honorius; whom yet thoſe Biſhops being graue men and impartiall, would not haue left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſured, if he had bene guilty of the ſame hereſy; as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would Paulus Diaconus, Theophanes Cerameus, Photius, and Zonaras in their Catalogues of the heretikes condemned in the ſixth Councell: eſpecially Photius, and Zonaras being profeſſed enemies to the Roman Church. And finally Emmanuel Calleca, a Grecian, with all the Latin hiſtorians<note n="(a)" place="margin">See Cocc. to <hi>1.</hi> l. <hi>7.</hi> arc, <hi>13.</hi> and Bell. l. <hi>4.</hi> de Pont. c. <hi>11.</hi>

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:181297:164"/>conſcience of Doctor Morton, that will ſpeake ſo vntruly! for doth bellarmine bring no other proofes, but <hi>his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture?</hi> Doth he not produce the teſtimonies of Honorius his Secretary, and of S.

Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, of Iohn the fourth, of Nicolas the firſt, of Theopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Iſaurus, of Emmanuel Calleca, and of all the Latine Fathers, that Honorius neuer aſſented to the Monothelites, but (euen in thoſe his very Epiſtles which are obiected) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended two wills, and operations in Chriſt, with all the Catholikes of the world? And doth he not proue the ſame, by the expreſſe teſtimony of Agatho Pope, affirming that, <hi>none of his predeceſsors were euer stayned with hereſy?</hi> and out of the ſixth Councell it ſelfe receauing this teſtimony of Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, as the words of S. Peter, and as an oracle of the Holy Ghoſt? Againe, doth he in all this ſay, that 639. Biſhops were deceaued? Nay doth he not proue by the teſtimony of Theophanes Iſautus, and Anaſtaſius, and collect the ſame out of many other authors, that the condemnation of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius, is not theirs, but falſly inſerted in their Councells by the Greekes, according to their ordinary cuſtome of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Councells, and other bookes in hatred to the See of Rome? <hi>Good God</hi> then, the ſeared conſcience of Doctor Morton, who can conceale all this, and lay hold on a few words, which Bellarmine addeth, to wit, that, <hi>if any man be ſo obstinat, that all this cannot ſatisfy him, he may receaue another ſolution from Turrecremata, which is, that the Fathers of the ſixth Synod condemned Honorius, but out of falſe information, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erred therin, as any Councell may in matter of fact.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon why you omit all the reſt of Bellarmines doctrine, &amp; catch at this ſolution of Turrecremata, is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that Popes may be heretikes, &amp; that not only as priuat Doctors (which ſome Catholikes grant) but in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike perſons, as Popes, becauſe, <hi>thoſe Fathers condemning Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius in their publike Councell did iudge him according to his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike perſon.</hi> Theſe your words<note n="(c)" place="margin">

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:181297:164"/>ſenſe is, that he cannot either in a Councell, or by himſelfe ordayne any hereticall doctrine to be receaued by the Church. Nor could you be ignorant of this: for as Canus (whon ye alleage) granteth, that Popes according to their priuat perſons may be heretikes, and that peraduenture one or two examples may be giuen therof, ſo in that very place<note n="(d)" place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. In making this Argument you ſhew great folly, it being ſo far from diſprouing the Popes authority, that it is an vnanſwerable proofe therof, as that ancient and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father Vincentius Lyrinenſis in his golden Treatiſe againſt the prophane nouelties of hereſies, conuinceth in theſe words<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.10.11.</note>: <hi>In tymes paſt Agrippinus of venerable memory Bishop of Carthage, the firſt of all mortall men maintained this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion againſt the diuine Scripture, against the rule of the vniuerſall
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:181297:173"/>Church, againſt the minde of all the Priests of his tyme, againſt the cuſtome and tradition of his fore Fathers, that Rebaptization was to be admitted, and put in practiſe. Which preſumption of his procured ſo great domage to the Church, that not only it gaue a paterne of ſacriledge to all beretikes, but alſo ministred occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of error to ſome Catholikes. When therfore all men euery where exclaimed againſt the Nouelty of that doctrine, and all Prieſts in all places, each one according to his zeale did repugne; then Pope Stephen of bleſſed memory, Bishop of the Apoſtolike See reſisted indeed with the rest of his fellow Bishops, but yet more then the reſt, thinking it, as I ſuppoſe, reaſon ſo much to excell all others in deuotion towards the fayth, as he was ſuperior to them in authority of place. To conclude, in his Epistle, which then was ſent to Africa, he decreed the ſame in theſe words: Let nothing be innouated, but that obſerued which came by tradition</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What then was the end of this whole buſineſſe? what els, but common, and vſuall? Antiquity was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, nouelty abandoned. But perhaps that new inuention wanted patrons; and defenders? To which I ſay on the contrary, that it had ſuch pregnant wits, ſuch eloquent tongues, ſuch number of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, ſuch shew of truth, ſuch teſtimonies of Scripture, but gloſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a new, and naughty fashion, that all that conſpiracy &amp; ſchiſme should haue ſeemed to me inuincible, had not the very profeſsion of nouelty it ſelfe, ſo taken in hand, vnder that name defended, &amp; with that title recommended, ouerthrowne the very ground of ſo great a ſchiſme. To conclude, what force had the Councell or decree of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca? By Gods prouidence, none; but all things there agreed vpon, were abolished, annulled, abrogated, as dreames, as fables, as ſuperfluous. And, O ſtrange mutation of things! the authors of that opinion are iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be Catholikes, and the followers accounted heretikes: the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters diſcharged, and the ſchollers condemned: the writers of thoſe bookes shall be children of the kingdome of heauen, and the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of them shall burne in bell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is of Vincentius Lyrinenſis, who tels you that albeit Cyprian, and other his Colleagues, authors of that doctrine, be Saintes in heauen, yet they that maintaine it now, after it hath bene condemned by the vniuerſall Church (as you do, iuſtifying Cyprian in his defence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of againſt Stephen Pope) ſhall burne for euer in hell;

               <p>Laſtly I muſt aduertiſe you of another abſurdity, whiles you tell vs<note n="(i)" place="margin">

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:181297:175"/>that we muſt rather belieue Firmilianus, a party, and for a tyme, guilty both of the hereſy of the Quarta decimans, &amp; of Rebaptization, then S.

                  </note> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted among the Catholike Biſhops in the Councell of Antioch, held againſt Paulus Samoſatenus.

                  </note>: which is a reaſon, not to be giuen, but by one, that knowes himſelfe bound to obey him that commands, if his command be not contrary to the commandment of God, as he thought Stephens to be, though erroneouſly, as you haue heard.</p>

                     <hi>Pag</hi> 172.178.181.287.</note>, with what conſcience do you make S. Cyprian fully oppoſite to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:181297:175"/>them, and to differ in maſters of fayth from them? for what els is that, but to make S. Cyprian an heretike, that ſo he may ſeeme to be like to your ſelfe? Now to your obiections of the full oppoſition of S. Cyprian to Pope Stephen.</p>
               <p>The firſt is<note n="(p)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 134.</note>, that S. Cyprian impugned the Popes pretended power of appeales to Rome: in proofe wherof you produce ignorantly the examples of Fortunatus and Feliciſſimus: for they appealed not to Pope Stephen, but to Cornelius, betwene whom and Stephen ſate Lucius an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Pope. Againe, the obiection is impertinent: for the definitions of Councells confirmed by the Popes, and the decrees of the Popes themſelues, ordeyne, that <hi>maior cauſes,</hi> that is to ſay, of fayth, and of Biſhops, be referred to the See Apoſtolike; but that <hi>minor cauſes,</hi> that is, of the liues &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Prieſts, and inferior clerkes, be finally ſentenced; &amp; ended in their owne prouinces, by their Biſhops, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, or by the Councells of their Prouince. This is declared by S. Auguſtine, who ſpeaking of Cecilianus B. of Carthage, that had bene condemned in Africa, by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of 70. Biſhops, ſayth<note n="(q)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ep.</hi> 162:</note>: <hi>There was no queſtion then of Prieſts, or Deacons, or other Clerkes of the inferior order, but of the Colleagues, that is so ſay, of Bishops, who might reſerue their cauſes intire to the iudgment of the other Colleagues, and principally of the Churches Apoſtolike: and therfore that Cecilian might haue contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the multitude of his enemies conſpiring against him, for as much as he ſaw himſelfe vnited by communicatory letters, with the Roman Church, in which the ſoueraignty of the See Apostolike had alwayes florished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſheweth the futility of your obiection. For Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus and Feliciſſimus were not Biſhops, but ſimple Prieſts, who hauing bene iudged by their owne Biſhops, ought not to haue appealed to Rome: and therfore Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius reiected their appeale, and excommunicated them (as S. Cyprian declares in that very Epiſtle, which you obiect) and returned Feliciſſimus back into Africa, with other his aſſociates ſent by Fortunatus: for Fortunatus himſelfe went not in perſon to Rome (as you miſtake) but ſent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſſimus with other Schiſmatikes like himſelfe. And that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:181297:176"/>S. Cyprian by complaining to Pope Cornelius, of theſe rebellious ſugiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s, did not deny his power of appeales, not the ſubiection of the African Churches to the See of Rome, his words in that very Epiſtle<note n="(r)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ep.</hi> 55.</note> three lines before (to goe no further) plainly declare; when ſpeaking of theſe Schiſmatikes he ſayth: <hi>They preſume to ſaile to the Chaire of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the principall Church, from whence ſacerdotall Vnity is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to carry betters from ſchiſmaticall and prophane perſons, not hauing in mind, that the Romans are they, whoſe fayth was praiſed by the mouth of the Apoſtle, and to whome vnfaithfulnes can haue no acceſse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your ſecond obiection is<note n="(s)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 134.</note> that, <hi>the Councell of Carthage did deny to any whomſoeuer, the title of Bishop of Bishops.</hi> This is an vntruth: for the words are not of the Councell, but of S. Cyprian, who ſpeaketh only of his fellow Biſhops of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, aſſembled with him in that Councell: and to them only he directs his ſpeach, wiſhing them to deliuer their opinion freely, without regard to the authority which he as their Primate had ouer them. But in what ſenſe ſoeuer you take the words, they are of no force, as being vttered in an erroneous Councell, which the Church hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which S. Auguſtine<note n="(t)" place="margin">L. <hi>6.</hi> de Baptiſm. per tot.</note> hath confuted, &amp; from which S. Cyprian himſelfe afterwards diſclaymed, retracting his error.</p>
               <p>Your third is<note n="(u)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 134.</note> that, <hi>S. Cyprian would not acknowledge the name of Pope per antonomaſiam, to be proper to the B. of Rome, as we teach: becauſe at the tyme of his Martyrdome, being demanded of the Proconſull: Art thou he, whom the Christians call their Pope? He anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weared him: I am.</hi> And I anſwere you, that this is a friuolous obiection: for as Onuphrius hath noted<note n="(x)" place="margin">Tract. voc. obſcur. Eccleſ.</note> the name of Pope anciently, vntill after the tyme of S. Gregory, was common to all Biſhops of great Cities, as of Rome, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, Alexandria, Antioch, Hieruſalem, and the like: and you afterwards ſhewing the futility of your obiection, proue the ſame<note n="(y)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 241.</note>. Wherfore S. Cyprian acknowledging that the Chriſtians of Africa (of whome only both he and the Proconſull ſpake) did call him <hi>Their Pope, and that he was ſo,</hi> did not acknowledge himſelfe to be Pope, <hi>per anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomaſiam</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:181297:176"/>(for in that ſenſe the name of Pope was not then vſed) but to be B. of Carthage, that is to ſay, the chiefe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Primate of all the Chriſtians of Africa. How then proueth this, that the name of <hi>Pope,</hi> being from the tyme of S. Gregory appropriated to the B. of Rome, to ſignify his ſupreme authority, doth not ſince that appropriation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be <hi>Pope per antonomaſiam?</hi> For words ſignify <hi>ad placitum,</hi> that which according to the common vſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of men they import.</p>
               <p>And finally, that the name of Pope when it is applied to the B. of Rome, importeth a ſingular dignity, proper to him alone, is conuinced by the Epithets which ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeaking to him, adde to that name, as when they call him <hi>Vniuerſall Pope:</hi> for ſo he is ſtyled by the Councell of Cyprus<note n="(z)" place="margin">Ep.

And yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you ſay, that the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was held in the yeare 416. and cite Binius as your Author for both. Binius ſpeaketh of two different Councells, held at Mileuis in thoſe ſeuerall yeares, and vnder different Conſuls; and you confound them, taking them both for one, and father your ignorance on Binius. And with like ignorance you affirme<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> the decree touching appeales to haue bene made by the Councell of Mileuis Anno 402. for
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:181297:177"/>the Councell held that yeare, was the firſt of Mileuis, in which the decree concerning appeales was not made, but in the ſecond Anno 416.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt remember, that when Bellarmine in proofe of the Popes vniuerſall authority, among other arguments, produceth examples of African Biſhops inſtituted, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by him, as alſo the ancient cuſtome of appealing to him out of Africa; you anſweare<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 289. <hi>&amp;</hi> 304.</note>, that the Africans are within the Popes Patriarkeſhip (which you call his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) and therfore rather ſubiect to him, then to others. If then the Africans were within the Popes Dioces, they were ſubiect to him as to their lawfull Iudge, and had right to appeale to him, and he to admit their appeales, and iudge their cauſes. Wherfore if in the Mileuitan, or any other Councell, or occaſion whatſoeuer, the Africans inhibited appeales out of Africa to the Pope, their inhibition was an act of diſobedience, and rebellion againſt their lawfull Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior; and no leſſe a crime, then if the ſubiects of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Monarke, ſhould forbid appeales to their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. With what face then can you iuſtify them therin?</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that you ſlaunder them iniuſtly: for as there is nothing more euident, then that the Councell of Carthage and this of Mileuis held in the cauſe of Pelagius and Celeſtius, did fully acknowledge the ſupreme authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pope, and profeſſed their obedience to him, both in words and deeds; ſo there is nothing more certaine, then that they denied not his prerogatiue of Appeales, without which his authority cannot conſiſt.</p>
               <p>If the African Biſhops did not belieue the ſoueraigne power of the See Apoſtolike, why did S. Cyprian addreſſe his Councell held in fauor of Rebaptization to Stephen Pope<note n="(e)" place="margin">S Hierom. aduerſ. Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note>? And why did the Councell of Carthage, held againſt Pelagius and Celeſtius, ſend their decrees to Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Pope, to be confirmed by his authority, ſaying<note n="(*)" place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>92.</hi>
                  </note>: <hi>This our proceeding (holy Lord and Brother) we conceaued we ought to repreſent to your Charity, that to the ſtatutes of our mediocrity, might be added the authority of the See Apoſtolike for the defence of many mens ſaluation, &amp; alſo for the correction of ſome mens froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:181297:177"/>Nor do they require this of Innocentius by way of charity only, but require him, as <hi>their Paſtor,</hi> to take compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them, <hi>Paſtoralibus viſceribus, with the bowels of mercy, which he as their Paſtor oweth to them as to his sheep.</hi> And hauing rehearſed the opinions of Pelagius and Celeſtius, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: <hi>What other things ſoeuer are obiected by them, we doubt not but that your Reuerence, when you haue examined the decrees of the Bishops, which are ſaid to be made vpon this occaſion in the East, will frame ſuch a iudgment, wherat we all may reioyce in the mercy of God.</hi>

But inſteed of prouing this you produce a Canon, in which (euen as it is reported by your ſelfe) no mention is made of Biſhops, but only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand giuen, that Prieſts, Deacons, or other inferior Clerkes appeale not from the Biſhops of their owne prouince, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Rome, or to any other tranſmarine Church: which
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:181297:179"/>no more impeacheth the ſoueraigne power of the Pope, or diſproueth his right of appeales out of Africa, then it would impeach the authority of the King of France, if to preuent the multitude of vnneceſſary ſuites, and keepe his people in awe of their immediate Superiors, his Maieſty, and his Courts of Parliament with his aſſent, ſhould prouide by a ſpeciall law, that in minor cauſes, no appeales be made fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>To this I adde, that Innocentius confirmed this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Mileuis<note n="(d)" place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>93.</hi>

And the ſame is confirmed out of S. Auguſtine, who was preſent at the Councell of Mileuis, and ſpeaking of Cecilian Archbiſhop of Carthage, that had bene iniuſtly condemned by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts in a Councell of 70.

               <p>This diſcourſe of S. Auguſtine conuinceth that Biſhops may appeale to Rome, though Prieſts, and other inferior Clerkes may not. How comes it then to paſſe, that you ſay<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pag. <hi>323.</hi>

Thirdly there is <hi>Diſobedience moral,</hi> in matter of good life &amp; manners, againſt precepts enacted by the Church, for the better auoyding &amp; puniſhing of ill behauiour. Now in the ſtate of this kind of Diſobedience men may be ſaued: for the diſobeying of theſe kind of orders and commands, may proceed either from <hi>contumacy</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> or from <hi>errour</hi>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:181297:192"/>and <hi>ignorance.</hi> If out of <hi>contempt,</hi> then is it damnable, ſo that none dying therin can be Martyrs, or goe to heauen.

               <p>And if the moſt religious Emperors, and Kings, haue held the Pope in ſo great veneration, that becauſe they knew him to be the chiefe Vicar, and Lieutenant of Chriſt on earth, they haue honored him, with kiſſing his feet, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the office of yeomen of his ſtirrop<note n="(z)" place="margin">See about Chap. <hi>10.</hi>

But is this all? Doth not Bellarmine giue another reaſon of far more weight? Why do you conceale it? But be it as Bellarmine coniectureth, that if the Popes had bene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally preſent, <hi>the Greeke Bishops would haue giuen prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of place to their Emperors,</hi> how do you proue, that in ſo doing, they ſhould haue done well? for they would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe haue placed Epiphanius Patriarke of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:181297:212"/>in a ſeate equall to Iohn the firſt Pope of that name, but that the ſupreme dignity of the See Apoſtllike enforced them to deſiſt from that attempt, and to ſet the Pope in a more eminent throne, exalted aboue that of Epiphanius in his owne Church<note n="(e)" place="margin">Nicephoe l. <hi>17.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi>

Nor is it likely, that the moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Emperors of the Eaſt, who haue profeſſed themſelues dutifull, and obedient Children to the See Apoſtolike, wold haue taken place of the Popes their ſpirituall Fathers &amp; Paſtors, if it had bene offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their Biſhops.</p>
               <p>But beſide Bellarmines reaſons, there are others. As 1. That the Popes being aged men, and ſeparated by a large diſtance of ſea and land from the Eaſt, in which the eight firſt Generall Councels were held, were not fit to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo long iourneys. 2. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (as the Fathers of the firſt Councell of Arles ſayd to Silueſter,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ep. ad Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſtr.</note> expreſſing their griefe, that they could not haue his preſence at their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And for that, before the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thoſe Eaſterne Councels, the Pope did vſually hold Councels in the Weſt, and ſend his Legates into the Eaſt, with the votes of the Weſterne Biſhops, arming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with authority, to preſide in his place, and with direction how to order things in thoſe Eaſterne Councels.</p>
               <p>As for Vigilius Pope, though he were preſent at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, when the fifth generall Councell was held in that City, he would not aſſiſt in perſon, becauſe he being then lawfull Pope, by election of the Clergy of Rome, would giue no occaſion of renewing the memory of his entrance into the Papacy by intruſion, &amp; ſimony, whiles Siluerius his predeceſſor was liuing; and chiefly, becauſe ſeeing the Emperor violently bent to haue the <hi>Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> (which were the ſubiect of that Councell) condemned, though in his particular, he condemned them, yet for feare of breeding a ſchiſme in the Church, he would not be perſonally preſent at a Councell, in which they ſhould be publikely condemned, without the aſſiſtance of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Biſhops, who earneſtly withſtood their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

And that they may ſeeme to exact this plenitude of authority by diuine Law, Pope Innocent the ihird maketh this Papall Decree, concluding the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors to be ſubiect to the Popes, becauſe it is written, God made two great lights, the Sunne to rule the day, and the Moone to gouerne the night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:181297:213"/>
                  <p>This argument you take out of an epiſtle of Innocent, written to the Emperor of Conſtantinople, who concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that Innocent in a letter had reprehended him, for his irreuerence to the Patriarke of Conſtantinople, wondred therat. And the cauſe of his wonder was, becauſe S. Peter ſayth<note n="(i)" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.</note>, <hi>Be ye ſubiect to euery humane creature, whether it be to the King, as excelling or to the rules ſent by him, to the reuenge of thoſe that do ill.</hi> Innocent in his anſwere hauing proued eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the Emperor miſunderſtood S. Peters words, addeth, <hi>that he might haue learned the prerogatiue of Prieſthood, by what God himſelfe ſpake, not to a King, but to a Priest; Behold I haue constituted thee ouer kingdomes and nations</hi> &amp;c. But in that whole Epiſtle he maketh no decree, either for depoſing, or excommunicating Kings, or Emperors, or for puniſhing them corporally, or ſpiritually, or for depriuing them of their Kingdomes, and liues, or concerning any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but only proueth the receaued doctrine of the ancient Fathers, that the Epiſcopall dignity excelleth the Imperial, <hi>as for as the Sunne ſurpaſseth the Moone, &amp; the ſoule the body: Which</hi> (ſayth he to the Emperor) <hi>if your Imperiall Highneſse did pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conſider, you would not cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor permit the Patriarke of Constantinople, a great, and honorable member of the Church, to ſit on the left ſyde at your footstoole, being that other Princes riſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to their Archbishops, and Bishops (as is fit they should) and appoint them a Venerable ſeate, neare to their owne perſons. Nor did I write to you, by way of reprehenſion, though I might with reaſon haue reprehended;</hi> becauſe (as there he explicates) Chriſt made Peter, and in him, his Succeſſors, Paſtors of his whole flock, not exempting Kings or Emperors.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſumme of Innocents Epiſtle, in which you ſee, he doth not ſo much as check the Emperor, but in a ſweet and Fatherly way, admoniſh him of his want of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Patriarke of Conſtantinople. Is it not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable falſhood to ſay, this Epiſtle is <hi>a Papall decree, wherby Innocent and other Popes of after ages challenge an abſolute power by diuine Law, ouer all Christian and Heathen Kings, and Emperors, to punish them, as well by corporall, as by ſpirituall punishments, euen to the depriuing them of their Kingdomes, and liues?</hi> Is any ſuch

But then it is euident againſt you, that as S.

And this Obedience was performed by the Popes of Rome, whiles they were not temporall Princes themſelues. But now being, and hauing bene for many yeares temporall Monarkes, as abſolute in their eſtates, as other Princes in theirs, it can no more be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred out of your text, that Popes are ſubiect to Kings, then that the King of Spaine, is ſubiect to the King of France.</p>

Leo Pope, and to blot out of the ſacred records, the names of Dioſcorus, Acacius, and other heretikes. The Emperor feigned himſelfe willing to performe the conditions, hoping therby to compaſſe his intent, but neuer performed them; and therfore Hormiſdas wold not aſſent to the gathering of a Councell. Wherupon Anaſtaſius growing into a great fury, writ threatning let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to him, and raiſed a great perſecution againſt Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: for which, as alſo for his obſtinacy in hereſy, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the See Apoſtolike, he ended his life in a moſt horrible manner, being ſtrucken dead with a thunder-bolt from Heauen.

But that it may appeare how you abuſe your readers, and hearers, inferring from hence, that Adrian acknowledged ſubiection to the Emperor, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that in that very Epiſtle, he often calleth Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and Irene, <hi>His belieued children,</hi> and exhorteth them by the examples of Conſtantine the great, Helena his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the reſt of the Orthodoxe Emperors, to exalt, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and reuerence the holy Catholike Apoſtolike Roman

                  <p>There are two kindes of <hi>Anathema:</hi> the one, iudiciary, that is to ſay, an Eccleſiaſticall Cenſure pronounced by an Eccleſiaſticall Superior, againſt them ouer whom he hath lawfull power and iuriſdiction, wherby he abandoneth their fellowſhip and communion, and commandeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the like, and withall depriueth them of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the Sacraments, and ſeruice of the Church.

And this is ſo certaine, that howbeit euery Proteſtant Miniſter, may at his pleaſure abandon the fellowſhip, and communion of any other man, and in that ſenſe, denounce <hi>Anathema</hi> vnto him, yet neuer any was ſo abſurdly ignorant, as to thinke, he could excommunicate any one, ouer whom he had not Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall power, and iuriſdiction.

<pb n="534" facs="tcp:181297:238"/>that when you excommunicate Catholikes, or others, you do not only deny them your owne fellowſhip, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but by vertue therof, forbid all others to haue commerce and communication with them?

In this ſenſe S. Hilary neither did, nor was ſo ignorant, as to thinke, he could denounce Anathema to Liberius, being not his Superior: and therfore neither did, nor could excommunicate him.</p>
                  <p>Another kind of Anathema there is, which is not iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, but only executory, wherby euery particular perſon eccleſiaſtick, or laick, man, or woman proteſteth, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to hold for <hi>Anathema,</hi> ſuch as are excommunicated by the Church. In this ſenſe S. Hilary pronounced <hi>Anathema</hi> to Liberius, for hauing ſubſcribed to the baniſhment of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius, and therby entred into Communion with the Arians.</p>
                  <p>The iudiciary <hi>Anathema,</hi> that is, the ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication had bene pronounced before, by the Councells of Nice and Sardica againſt the Arians in generall, into whoſe communion Liberius was entred. There was no need of pronouncing a new ſentence of <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt him, but of applying the ſentence of the Councells vnto him, by abiuring and abhorring him, as one fallen into the ſentence which the Councels had pronounced againſt the Arians.

                  <p>This I haue ſaid, not queſtioning, but ſuppoſing Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius his ſubſcription to the condemnation of Athanaſius; which yet ſome haue denied<note n="(s)" place="margin">See Bellar. l. <hi>4.</hi> de Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif. c, <hi>9.</hi>

                     <hi>S.

Impertinent; for were it true (as it is not) that S.

It is alſo vntrue; for S.

In regard wherof, he deemed it no preſumption in himſelfe, to write vnto him, that by his authority, he might know whoſe communion to imbrace, and whoſe to auoyd.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond obiection<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 206.</note>, is a repetition of what you haue formerly ſayd of Liberius his fall from the Catholike fayth, into hereſy, by ſubſcribing to the condemnation of Athanaſius, &amp; communicating with the Arians. You haue bene anſweared, that Liberius aſſented to his condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not for any error in fayth, but for crimes forged againſt him by the Arians: in ſo much that Athanaſius himſelfe euen in that excuſeth him, ſaying<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ep. ad So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit.</note>: <hi>He was compelled therto by force of torments, and therfore that which terrors and feares extorted from him, ought not to bethought his ſentence, but that which he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced freely, when no violence was offered vnto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly you obiect: <hi>S. Hierome in deſpight, and indignation, calleth Rome Babylon and land of captiuity, and tearmeth it a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whore, and strange land, wherin he could not ſing the Lords ſong, concerning the holy Ghost: yea he beſpots the whole Clergy of that City with the note of ignorance: and at laſt (after the death of Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) he quit Rome, as a land of bondage that he might enioy his liberty in Iudaea, among the Chriſtian Iewes. Could this be ſaid of a City pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged with a perpetuall reſidence of the holy Ghoſt, and deſeruing the title of Motherhood ouer the whole Catholike Church?</hi> This is your queſtion; and my anſweare is, That S. Hierome, when he calleth Rome, <hi>Babylon, a land of captiuity, and a purple whore,</hi> giues thoſe names to Rome, not as to the ſeat of Religion, but of the Empire; not to the Church, but to the Imperiall Court, and Senat; not to the eccleſiaſticall, but to the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike ſtate of Rome; to the troopes of Courtiers, ſolicitors, &amp; negotiants; &amp; finally not ſo much in regard of ſecular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as of Monkes, by reaſon of the diſtractions, that the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:181297:241"/>noyſe, confuſion, and tumult of men, and affaires, in ſo great a city, brought to Monaſtical ſilence &amp; recollection: for ſo it is plaine out of his Epiſtle to Marcella<note n="(m)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep.</hi> 16.</note>, in which though inuiting her to leaue Rome, and go to Hieruſalem, he call Rome <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet he preſently addeth, <hi>It is true, that in that City, is the holy Church: there are the trophies of the Apoſtles, and Martyrs: there is the true confeſsion of Christ: there is the fayth cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the Apoſtle, &amp; the Chriſtian name euery day exalted by the depreſsion of Paganiſme troden vnder foot. But the ambition, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and greatneſſe of that City, to viſit and to be viſited, to ſalute &amp; to be ſaluted, to flatter, and detract, to heare, and ſpeake, nay to ſee, though vnwillingly ſo great a multitude of men, are things farre from the purpoſe and quiet of thoſe, that would follow a monaſticall life.</hi> This ſheweth, that when S. Hierome cals Rome <hi>Babilon, &amp; purple whore,</hi> he ſpeakes not of the Church, but of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtate of Rome. And when he cals it <hi>a land of captiuity,</hi> he ſpeakes it in regard of the noyſe, confuſion, and tumult, not ſuiting with the retirement of Monkes: which inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience he noteth alſo in the City of Hieruſalem, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (ſayth<note n="(n)" place="margin">Ep. <hi>13.</hi> ad Pauli. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis</note> he) by reaſon of the places of the Croſſe, and Reſurrection, were a dwelling much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by Monkes.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of your obiection, that <hi>S. Hierome beſpote the whole Clergy of that City, with the note of ignorance,</hi> is your falſe comment. He complaineth only of a few Prieſts, and Deacons of Rome, who being iealous of his faour with Pope Damaſus, and enuiyng the great reuerence which the deuout Ladies of Rome bare to his perſon, Damaſus being dead, toke boldneſſe to raiſe ſlanders againſt him, accuſing him, that he had tranſlated Didymus an hereticall Author, that he had conuerſed too familiarly with the great Ladies of Rome, and perſuaded them to quit their Countrey, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and friends, to leaue the world, and ſhut themſelues vp, as recluſes, in the Monaſteries of Paleſtine. Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint no way toucheth the fayth of the Roman Church, nor the ſucceſſion of S. Peter, nor the communion of the See Apoſtolike, nor maketh againſt the perpetuall reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the holy Ghoſt in that Church, S. Hierome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

But you regard not what you ſay of that renowned Doctor, if you may make him like to your ſelfe in diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Church of Rome, <hi>in matter of neceſſary and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine.</hi> But let vs heare in what he diſagreed: Becauſe S. Hierome ſayth, <hi>that although formerly all other Churches in the East, did account S. Pauls Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, Canonicall; yet it was not receaued as Canonicall in the Latine, or Roman Church.</hi> From whence you tooke theſe words I know not: for no ſuch are to be found in his Epiſtle to Euagrius, out of which you alleage them. Part of them I find in his Commentary vpon Iſaias, and in his Epiſtle to Dardanus, where he ſaith: <hi>The Epistle to the Hebrewes is receaued as Canonicall, by all the Greeke Churches, though the cuſtome of the Latines receaue it not:</hi> But that the Roman Church receaues it not, is an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous addition of yours to S. Hieromes text: for when he ſayth, <hi>The cuſtome of the Latines receaues it not,</hi> that by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Latines, he vnderſtands not all the Latine or Roman Church, he declareth, ſaying<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ep. ad Euag.</note>; <hi>All the Greekes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Epistle to the Hebrewes, &amp; nonnulli Latinorum, and many of the Latines.</hi> Yea when he infinuateth that ſome of the Latines receaued it not, he ſpeaketh not of the Latines of his time, but of ſome that liued before him, as Tertullian, S. Cyprian, Lactantius &amp; Arnobius, who in their workes are not found to alleage this Epiſtle. But ſince the tyme of Lactantius, the Latine Fathers haue bene ſo far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any doubt that it is Canonicall, that Philaſtrius<note n="(b)" place="margin">In Catal. haereſ.</note> a Latine Father and Biſhop of Breſſa in Italy, more ancient then S. Hierome, ranketh them among heretikes that deny it to be Canonicall. And in S. Hieromes time, Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius

If therfore Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Pope, with a Councell of 70.

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 213.</note>, that, <hi>the reaſon why Satyrus would not communicate with any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop that agreed not with the Roman Church, was, becauſe Sardinia was then diuided into diuers ſchiſmes, by hereticall ſpirits: No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell therfore, though Satyrus asked of a Bishop, whoſe fayth he ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted whether he belieued as that Church did, whoſe fayth was known to be truly Catholike; euen as if in tyme of rebellion, the Citizens of ſome one City (for example Yorke) were more generally knowne to profeſſe loyalty to their Soueraigne, an honest man comming into the kingdome, might aske the inhabitants, whether they agreed with the City of Yorke, therby to know, whether they were loyall ſubiects: and yet it would not follow, that therfore Yorke is the head of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> This your anſweare framed to puzzell an ignorant reader, is eaſely reiected. Satyrus did well know, and it was generally knowne both in the Eaſt, and Weſt, that at that time, not only the Church of Rome, but alſo that of Milan (of which Ambroſe his owne brother was then actually Biſhop, and famous ouer all the world) was ſound in fayth, and truly Catholike. Why then did not Satyrus, to informe himſelfe whether that Sardinian Biſhop were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, aske him, whether he agreed with the Biſhop and Church of Milan, but becauſe he knew, that neither the Church of Milan, nor any other, but the Roman, was the head of Catholike Communion, as S.

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 214.</note> out of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, that certaine Clergy-men of Milan 670. yeares after
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:181297:245"/>the death of S. Ambroſe, called the Biſhoprick of Milan, <hi>S. Ambroſe his Church,</hi> and withſtood Petrus Damianus the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes Legate, alleaging, <hi>that the Church of Ambroſe had bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies free in it ſelfe, and neuer ſubiect to the lawes of the Pope of Rome.</hi> But why do you conceale the truth of this hiſtory? The ancient ſplendor, and beauty of the Church of Milan being defaced, and greatly decayed, partly by the impurity of Clergy-men, that being infected with the hereſy of the Nicolaites, liued incontinently, and obſtinatly defended the ſame to be lawfull, and partly by Simoniacall Prieſts; the people of Milan ſent Legates to the Pope, beſeeching him to commiſerate the lamentable ſtate, and cure the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate diſeaſes of that famous Church. The Pope (not Leo the Ninth, as you miſtake, but) Nicolas the ſecond (bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween whom and Leo there were other two Popes, Victor and Stephen) condeſcending to ſo iuſt a requeſt, ſent two holy and learned men, Petrus Damiani Cardinall of Oſtia, &amp; Anſelme B. of Luca, as his Legates, to viſit that Church, and armed them with his owne authority, to correct the offenders, and ordayne whatſoeuer ſhould be thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, for the reformation of ſo great diſorders. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates being ariued at Milan, had no ſooner intimated their Commiſſion, but the people ſtirred vp by thoſe lewd, and factious Clergy-men, began to oppoſe them, alleaging that the Church of Ambroſe had bene alwais free in it ſelfe, and neuer ſubiect to the Lawes of the Pope of Rome. Theſe are the only words, which you cull out of Baronius whole narration, leauing out what precedeth, and making no mention of what followeth; which is, that Petrus Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miani ſtepping vp into the Pulpit, after he had quieted the people, proued effectually the ſoueraigne authority gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, to the Roman Church, ouer all Churches, &amp; that whoſoeuer denies that authority, is an heretike. The people giuing eare to his words, were appeaſed, and with one accord promiſed to do whatſoeuer he ſhould ordayne. There was preſent a great number of Clergy-men, and ſcarce any of them, that had not bene promoted to orders by Simony. For the remedy of ſo great a miſchiefe, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:181297:246"/>required from Guido the Archbiſhop, an inuiolable caution and promiſe, not to admit any from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to holy orders for money; and alſo to roote out the hereſy of the Nicolaites. Wherunto he willingly yeilded, with imprecation of Gods wrath, and reuenge on himſelfe, if he performed it not. He gaue this caution in writing, &amp; the Prieſts and Clerkes ſubſcribed vnto it. Which being done, he proſtrated himſelfe on the ground, asking pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Legates for his offence. And in like manner the Clergy-men admitting pennance, were reconciled in tyme of Maſſe, and receaued new ornaments from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops hand, hauing firſt made a profeſſion of their fayth, in which they anathematized all Hereſies extolling themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues againſt the holy Catholike and Apoſtolike Church, &amp; particularly thoſe of the Nicolaites and Symonians. This is the ſtory: and what greater folly can there be, then to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that S. Ambroſe a moſt holy and learned Doctor, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the authority of the Roman Church, becauſe a few lewd hereticall Clergy-men of Milan 670. yeares after his death, diſclaimed from the obedience of the B. of Rome, to the end they might hold on their damnable courſes, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape that puniſhment which their offences ſo iuſtly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? And can there be a greater Impoſture, then to alleage a few raſh words vttered by the people at the inſtigation of thoſe heretikes, &amp; to conceale that they togeather with the people &amp; Archbiſhop being admoniſhed by the Popes Legats, acknowledged their error with harty ſorrow, and promiſe of amendment, and obedience to the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?

But you that follow them in their diſobedience, why do you not alſo follow them in their repentance? When Theodoſius in excuſe of the great ſlaughter he had made at Theſſalonica, alleaged to S.

And leſt Hilary ſhold raiſe tumults, ſeeking to ſupport his cauſe by force of armes (as formerly he had done) Leo required of Valentinian the third, that if any ſuch attempt were made, he would cauſe it to be ſuppreſſed by Aetius, commander of the ſoldiers in France. This the Emperor performed, writing to Aetius that famous <hi>Reſcript,</hi> which afterwards Theodoſius the yonger inſerted in his new Conſtitutions, intituling it, <hi>The Law of Theodoſius, and Valentinian,</hi> in which he relateth the whole ſtory of Hilary, and profeſſeth his great veneration of the See Apoſtolike, and of the Popes ſupreme authority ouer all Churches, &amp; Biſhops, and particularly his right to conuent them before him, and preſcribe Lawes vnto them; ordaining withall, that if any Biſhop being ſummoned by him, ſhall refuſe to appeare, the Gouernor of the Prouince ſhall enforce him to obey, <hi>to the end</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that in all things, that Reuerence be obſerued, which our Parents bare to the Roman Church.</hi>

                  <p>Your anſweare, that <hi>when all is done, this Reſcript is but a humane Constitution,</hi> cannot auaile you: for Valentinian performing the duty of a godly Emperor, made this <hi>humane Conſtitution,</hi> to defend, and mantaine that authority, which <hi>by diuine inſtitution</hi> was giuen to S.

                     </note>, <hi>is taken from the authority of the holy Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 225.</note>: <hi>Hilary, notwithstanding the diſpleaſure of Pope Leo, was worthy for ſingular ſanctity, to be regiſtred in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Martyrologe of Saints.</hi> True. King Dauid alſo is a Saint, but not for his adultery committed with Bethſabee, nor for his murthering of Vrias. He is a Saint for his vertuous life before, and his great pennance after the committing of thoſe ſiunes. So like wiſe Hilary is a glorious Saint, cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized not for tranſgreſſing the limits of his iuriſdiction, but (ſayth Baronius<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 445.</note> 
                     <hi>for his zeale in the Catholike fayth, for his great labors againſt the Pelagians, for his pious liberality to the poore, &amp; other his excellent vertues: and finally, becauſe though for a tyme defending (as he ſuppoſed) the right of his See, he exceeded the limits of his iuriſdiction, yet that ſerued him for a ſpurre, to returne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with greater courage, feruor, and humility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I cannot but maruaile at your ſharpe ſight, that in this hiſtory can eſpy any thing to argue in S. Hilary diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Pope of Rome. Was his entrenching vpon the priuiledges of other Biſhops, done to oppoſe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? No. It was (as he ſuppoſed) to defend the rights of his owne Church. When he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained of to the Pope, did he deny his authority? Nay, did he not of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, goe to Rome, to giue account of his proceedings to him, as to his lawfull Superior? And when he was conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:181297:251"/>of his error, did he ſhew himſelfe refractary? Did he, not preſently returne to Arles, deſiſting from his claime, &amp; neuer ſo much as once opening his mouth, to make any the leaſt complaint againſt Leo? If therfore a miſt of hatred to the See Apoſtolike had not obſcured your eyes, you would haue ſeene, that as this hiſtory of S. Hilary doth no way infringe, but many wayes confirme the authority of the Pope; ſo it doth alſo ſhew your inconſideration, who to diſgrace S. Hilary, report his offence, but conceale his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, yea &amp; deny it; that ſo he may ſeeme to haue died impenitent, becauſe that fitteth your purpoſe, and ſuiteth beſt with your ſpirit, which whether it be good, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der iudge: for what ſpirit can that be, which teacheth you to publiſh the imperfections of the Saints, and deny their vertues?</p>

But God, that would not haue a man ſo well deſeruing of his Church, to die in the ſtate of excommunication, ordained by his prouidence, that the ſoule of Theophilus could not depart out of his body, vntill an Image of S. Chryſoſtome being brought vnto him, he adored it, doing pennance for his former error, and by that meanes reſtored himſelfe to the peace of the Church.

But his iudgment was erroneous: and becauſe what he did, was out of a pious zeale, as he conceaued, God reduced him by a miraculous Viſion, wherin he ſaw himſelfe caſt out of the Church by Chryſoſtome, and a troupe of Saints that aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him therin; but that the Bleſſed Virgin Mary did make interceſſion for him, as one that had defended her honor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Neſtorius.

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 288.</note>: <hi>Anciently, Inſtitutions of Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, and Patriarkes, were done by communicatory letters to the chiefe Patriarke, which were letters of correſpondence, to shew their agreement in fayth: in which caſe, the B. of Rome ſent his Pall in token of his conſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the B. of Rome hath euer accuſtomed to inſtitute Biſhops in the moſt remote Prouinces of the world, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of the booke intituled, <hi>Vitae Romanorum Pontificum,</hi> written by Damaſus, or (as others more probably thinke) by Anaſtaſius Bibliothecarius, in which are reported the ordinations of Biſhops made by Linus, immediate ſucceſſor to S. Peter, and ſucceſſiuely by all other Biſhops of that See. The letters you mention, of Metropolitans, &amp; Patriarkes, written at the tyme of their Inſtitution, to the chiefe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke (the B. of Rome) were not only <hi>of correſpondence, to shew their agreement in fayth:</hi> for howbeit they did containe a profeſſion of their agreement in fayth with the Roman Church, that therby they might be receaued into her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and haue the title of Catholike Biſhops: yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer, they contayned an oath of Obedience, and ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the B. of Rome. And by the ſame letters, they asked his Pal, which (S. Gregory witneſſes<note n="(i)" place="margin">

                  <p>It is true, that the Pope by ſending his Pal to Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, did expreſſe his conſent to their Inſtitution. But if they did not owe ſubiection to him, there had bene no need of requiring his conſent, and much leſſe, of asking his Pal: for the Pal did not only containe an expreſſion
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:181297:273"/>of the Popes conſent to their Inſtitution, but a grant of great authority, and power, which by the Pal was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and giuen vnto them.

A ſhift; for when his Maieſty makes a law, with the aſſiſtance of his Parliament; or the Lord Archbiſhop of Canterbury an Eccleſiaſticall decree, with a Councell of his Suffraga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, were it not ſophiſtry to argue from thence, that his Maieſty is not ſupreme gouernor in his dominions, or that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chbiſhop of Canterbury hath not iuriſdiction ouer his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans? No leſſe then it is to argue, that the Pope hath not iuriſdiction ouer other Biſhops, becauſe he depoſeth, or reſtoreth them not, without a Councell. For as it is not neceſſaty, that a King in his kingdome, or an Archbiſhop in his Dioces, exerciſe all actes of Iuriſdiction, alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aduice, or helpe of their ſubiectes: ſo neither is it, that the Pope inſtitute, depoſe, or reſtore Biſhops, alone, without the aduice, and helpe of a Councell.

Is this good Diuinity? And yet it is yours; who from this definition, as from a true principle, deduce, that when ancient Popes excommunicated here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Biſhops of the Eaſterne Church, it was no act of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in them ouer thoſe Bishops, but<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>

Ambroſe<note n="(r)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> writing to Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus) <hi>hauing committed the right of examining this cauſe to your vnanimity, and to our other Colleagues of Aegypt. it is neceſsary, that you ſummon againe our brother Flauianus.</hi> And moreouer he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſeth Theophilus, that he ought to cary the buſineſſe ſo, as that the finall deciſion therof might be reſerued to the B of Rome, and confirmed by him. <hi>We conceaue</hi> (ſayth he)<note n="(s)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>that you ought to referre the cauſe to our holy brother B of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man Church: for we preſume, you will iudge ſo, as cannot diſpleaſe him.</hi> And al uſe after: <hi>When hauing receaued the tenor of your acts, we shall ſee, you haue iudged things ſo, as the Roman Church shall vndoubtedly allow therof, we will receaue with ioy the fruit of your examination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this it appeares, that S Ambroſe held the B of Rome to be the ſupreme Iudge of Biſhops, and that to him apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the finall deciſion of their cauſes. And the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares yet further in this, that S.

                        <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note>: <hi>Theophilus</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſending the Prieſt Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, appeaſed Damaſus that was offended, and repreſented to him,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:181297:286"/>that it was profitable for the concord of the Church, to parſon the fault of Plauianus: and ſo the Communion was reſtered to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, notwithſtanding that the Emperor fauoured Flauianus, and tooke vpon him to plead his cauſe in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Rome, yet he neuer was receaued as Patriarke of Antioch; nor his Legates admitted, vntill the Pope at the intreary of ſo great perſonages, had pardoned his fault, and confirmed him in that See.</p>
                  <p>This is the true hiſtory of Flauianus, which you haue ſingled out, as an eſpeciall example of retorſion againſt Bellarmine, to proue the Popes no-iuridicall authority ouer the Patriarkes of Antioch; but you performe it not: for this example euidently ſheweth the Popes authority exerciſed ouer the Eaſterne Churches, many wayes; as 1. In annulling the Confirmation of Flauianus made in the Councell of Conſtantinople. 2. In calling thoſe Biſhops to Rome, to put the cauſe in triall againe: nor did they in their anſweare except againſt his authority, to call them, but humbly acknowledging him to be <hi>their head, and themſelues to be his members,</hi> excuſed their not coming for want of time, and other reaſons expreſſed in their Epiſtle. 3. In calling not only the Weſterne, but alſo the Eaſterne Biſhops to the Councell of Capua, they obeying his command. 4. By the Epiſtle of S. Ambroſe, wiſhing Theophilus to procure a confirmation of his ſentence from the B. of Rome. 5. By the interceſſion of Theophilus, of S. Chryſoſtome, and of the Emperor Theodoſius himſelfe, made to the Pope to pardon Flauianus his fault, and to confirme him in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike of Antioch. And 6. by the Legates, which Flauia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus himſelfe in the end was faine to ſend to the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could be receaued, as true Biſhop of that See: which he needed not to haue done, if his confirmation had not depended on the Popes approbation.</p>
                  <p>All this being manifeſt out of Socrates, and Sozomen, (whom Bellarmine citeth) and alſo out of S.

<pb n="629" facs="tcp:181297:286"/>to one of Flauianus his Succeſſors, was a great fauores of his perſon, and hath reported his cauſe, with more rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fauor, then to truth. For firſt<note n="(x)" place="margin">

He mentioneth not this oath of Flauianus, but ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that he came to the Biſhoprike, by a lawfull and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall election, without breach of any oath. 3. To make good the cauſe of Flauianus againſt Euagrius, he reporteth, that Paulinus alone, before his death, ordained Euagrius, contrary to the Lawes of the Church, when as Socrates<note n="(y)" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> and Sozomen<note n="(z)" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> impartiall writers teſtify, that Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius was not ordained by Paulinus, but by his Diſciples after his yeath. 4. Nor is he to be credited in his report, that Theodoſius hauing heard Flauianus at Conſtantinople, did not preſſe him to goe to Rome, but bid him returne home to Antioch, and that coming himſelfe afterwards to Rome, he vndertooke to anſweare for Flauianus, and to plead his cauſe in iudgment.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding, euen this relation of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret (partiall as it is) proueth the iuridicall authority of the Pope ouer the Patriarkes or Antioch, if it be taken enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, as it is ſet downe by him, and not mangled as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it: for he ſayth<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</note>, <hi>The Bishops of Rome, not only that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man Damaſus, but alſo after him Siricius, and Anaſtaſius ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to Siricius, inueighed greatly againſt the Emperor, telling him, here preſſed them that practiſed tyranny againſt himſelfe, but left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished thoſe, that by tyranny ſought to ouerthrow the lawes of Chriſt.</hi> Wherupon, as the Emperor before had commanded him, ſo now againe he labored to compell him, to goe to Rome, to haue his cauſe iudged there. This ſheweth that the Emperor acknowledged no leſſe obligation in the greateſt Patriarkes to obey the Pope, then in the ſubiects of the Empire to obey the Emperor; and that ſuch Biſhops, as
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:181297:287"/>ſhew themſelues diſobedient to him, violate the Lawes of Chriſt, and deſerue no leſſe puniſhment, then ſubiects that rebell againſt their Prince. Againe: <hi>The Emperor</hi> (ſayth Theodoret<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>comming long after that tyme to Rome, and being blamed againe by the Bishops, for not repreſsing the tyranny of Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uianus, ſaid, he would take vpon himſelfe the perſon of Flauianus, and pleade his cauſe in iudgment:</hi> which laſt clauſe, you in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Theodorets words omit, becauſe it ſheweth, that the iudgment of Flauianus his cauſe belonged to the Court of Rome: for the pleading of cauſes in iudgment, is only before them, that haue authority to iudge.</p>
                  <p>Finally, though Theodoret relate partially this ſtory of Flauianus, yet that he intended not therby, to deny the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope ouer the Biſhops of Antioch, appeareth, not only by what hath bene here proued to the contrary, but alſo becauſe in expreſſe words he profeſſeth<note n="(c)" place="margin">In Ep. ad Kenat.</note> that, <hi>the Roman See hath the sterne of gouerment ouer all the Churches of the world;</hi> and therfore he being a Suffragan of the Patriarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Antioch, when he was depoſed from his Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prike, by the ſecond Councell of Epheſus, had not recourſe to his owne Patriarke, for redreſſe, but appealed to Leo Pope, and by him was reſtored.

                  <p>All this ſheweth, how vntruly you ſay<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pag. <hi>296.</hi> fin.</note>, that <hi>Damaſus depoſed not Flauianus, nor executed any act of iuridic all proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him but that he was confirmed in his Bishoprike by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:</hi> for Damaſus annulled the ſentence of the Councell of Conſtantinople that had confirmed him, and cited both the Fathers of that Councell, and him, to appeare at Rome, to haue his cauſe tried there; and therupon the Emperor once, and twice vrged him to goe: and Siricius ſucceſſor to Damaſus, gaue to Theophilus Patriarke of Alexandria, power to iudge his cauſe.

And therefore Bellarmine<note n="(s)" place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> de Pont. c. <hi>22.</hi>
                     </note> out of Leo, and Liberatus, rightly obſerueth, that this Canon obiected by Nilus, was neuer receaued in the Church, as being vnlawfully made in abſence of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes Legates, who preſided in the Councell. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this controuerſy, in the proſecution wherof, you falſify the Councell of Calcedon, and are guilty of ſome other errors, of which I ſhall briefly aduertiſe you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Therfore Bellarmine truly ſayth, that cuſtome (the beſt interpreter of lawes) plainly ſheweth, it was neuer lawfull to appeale to the B. of Conſtantinople, but only from places within his owne Patriarkſhip: and that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample can be giuen of an Appeale made to the Eaſterne Church, out of the Weſt, South, or North. You to croſſe Bellarmine, ſay<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 310.</note>, that <hi>the Councell of Calcedon ſpeaketh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of euery Church;</hi> and in proofe therof falſify the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, adding to the beginning of the Canon, theſe words. <hi>In quacunque Eccleſia, In euery Church,</hi> putting them downe in a different character, as the words of the Canon, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both it and them out of Binius, who hath this Canon<note n="(u)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 129.</note>, of three different verſions, and yet no ſuch words in any of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You haue hitherto pretended, &amp; afterwards repeate, againe, that no one man can be Head of the whole Church on earth. Yet now vpon condition, that the Pope may not haue that dignity, you are contented to allow it the B. of Conſtantinople. For you ſay<note n="(x)" place="margin">Pag. <hi>302.</hi> fin.</note>: <hi>We confeſse, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme right of appeales is proper to a Monarke, it being as eſsentiall a part of his Monarchy, to haue the right of appeales, as it is for him to be a Monarke:</hi> from whence it will follow, that you here
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:181297:298"/>granting to the B. of Conſtantinople, a ſupreme right of appeales from all the Churches of the world, make him a Monarke ouer all the Churches of the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Out of the gradation which the Councell maketh from Clerke to Biſhop; from Biſhop to Archbiſhop; from Archbiſhop to the Pope, or the B. of Conſtantinople, you inferre the Biſhop of Conſtantinople to be aboue the Pope which is a ſenſeleſſe paradoxe, collected from a falſe grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for if becauſe an Archbiſhop is to be iudged by the Pope, or by the B. of Conſtantinople, you may inferre the B. of Conſtantinople to be equall with the Pope, or aboue him; you may by like conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce inferre, that in an army, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell is equall to the Generall, or aboue him, becauſe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldier is to be iudged by his Captaine, &amp; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by his Generall, or by his Coronell: for in this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation the Coronell is the laſt, and therfore by your rule, <hi>the highest, and most excellent.</hi> With ſuch ſophiſtry you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare our arguments, and frame your owne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Bellarmine ſayth: <hi>The Councell is to be vnderstood of the firſt iudgement:</hi> But this (ſay you)<note n="(y)" place="margin">

                     <hi>euidently croſseth the Popes expoſition.</hi> Falſe: for the Pope alloweth to the B. of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople permiſſiuely the firſt iudgement of Eaſterne cauſes, if the parties be willing to accept of his iudgment; but not the ſecond by way of appeale, out of his owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkeſhip.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Why do you conceale, what Bellarmine, and Binius adde? namely, that if we ſhould grant to you, your inference out of this Canon, it would not follow, that the B. of Conſtantinople is of equal authority with the Pope: for the Popes power extendeth not only to right them which are wronged by their Metropolitans, but alſo to iudge the Metropolitans, and Patriarkes themſelues, and to right the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen when they are wronged by whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Biſhops; as the examples of Athanaſius, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Flauianus, Theodoret, and others conuince.</p>

                  <p>And to proceed methodically, I will reduce what I am to ſay, to two heades. 1.

That the inhabitants of theſe nations, which are not Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, are not of one beliefe, or Communion with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, but wholly diſſent from them, holding moſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, and damnable hereſies, acknowledged for ſuch by Proteſtants themſelues. From whence it will follow, that you affirming them to be <hi>faythfull Christians, of the ſame beliefe with the ancient Fathers,</hi> charge the ancient Fathers with blaſphemous hereſies, and make them incapable of ſaluation.</p>

Wherfore for as much as concernes vs, you haue freed vs from

But this is not your only error in fayth: for you hold many other old condemned hereſies; as with Simon Magus, that only fayth iuſtifieth: With Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, you deny Purgatory, and prayer for the dead: With Iouinian you equall Mariage with Virginity, yea and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, ſurpaſſing him therin.

Wherfore it was no generall, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Councell, in which Menas preſided, not as Vicar of the See Apoſtolike (as Binius miſtaketh) but only as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke of Conſtantinople.

Why do you conceale all theſe particulars? Why do you not deale ingenuouſly, giuing your Reader notice of them? Nay, why do you profeſſe (o), <hi>that you had ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into Luthers confeſsion hereof, with a purpoſe, that if any ſuch thing should ſenſibly appeare, then vtterly to abhorre Luthers name, &amp; ſuſpect all his doctrine?</hi> We finde, and it is manifeſt, that your meaning agreeth not with your wordes: for vndertaking to anſweare for Luther, you anſweare not, but confeſſe the thing, and inſteed of anſwearing, obiect another ſtory, which Delrius reporteth of the Diuel appearing to an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, in forme of an Angell, and perſuading him to ſay Maſſe. If this were true, it could be no reliefe to Luthers cauſe. But to make it true, you falſify Delrius: for he ſayth not, that the Diuell perſwaded an Abbot to ſay Maſſe, but that he perſwaded a Monke, that was not a Prieſt to ſay Maſſe: which as it was a perſwaſion fit to proceed from the Diuell, ſo is it a very fit example to iuſtify Luthers inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and doctrine receaued from the Diuell.</p>
                  <p>It is therfore moſt certaine, that the Diuell appeared to Luther, and diſputed with him, and that Luther being ouercome with his arguments, abandoned the Maſſe. And
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:181297:339"/>his Diſciples of Wittemberge, moued by his example, did the like: and, as he did, ſo alſo did they ſet forth a booke of their reaſons, which (as Brereley hath noted)<note n="(p)" place="margin">Luthers life Chap. <hi>1.</hi> ſect. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nor do you produce here any thing to the contrary, which hath not bene proued to be impoſterous, excepting only that here you charge <hi>the new Church of Rome</hi> (for ſo you call it) <hi>with belieuing, the concluſion of the Pope in matters of fayth to be infallible, albeit he vſe no diligence at all for the directing of his iudgment; which is</hi> (ſay you) <hi>the strong breath of an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſticall, and Enthuſiaſticall ſpirit.</hi> We are well aſſured, what ſpirit guydeth your pen.

In your margent you cite Valentia in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Chapter of his <hi>Analyſis:</hi> which is to cite at randome, and falſly: for that worke of Valentia conſiſteth of eight bookes: you ſpecify none of them; nor are the words, you obiect, to be found in the ſeauenth Chapter of any one of thoſe eight bookes. I find ſome ſuch in the third Chapter of his laſt booke; where, as alſo afterwards againe<note n="(n)" place="margin">Analy. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note>, he profeſſedly diſputeth, what meanes the Pope is bound to vſe in his definitions of fayth, and whether the infallibility of his iudgment depend vpon thoſe meanes? In which queſtion Valentia teacheth nothing, but what is the moſt receaued opinion of Deuines, and moſt agreeable to truth.</p>
                  <pb n="739" facs="tcp:181297:341"/>
                  <p>There ſeemeth to be ſome diſagreement in this point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Schoole-Doctors, ſome ſaying, that the Pope cannot erre, if he proceed maturely, hearing the counſell of Paſtors, and Learned men: Others (of which number Valentia is) affirming, that he cannot erre, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine alone, without deliberation, and conſultation. But theſe two opinions differ in words only, not in reality of truth: for when the authors of the former opinion ſay, that to define, the Pope is bound to proceed maturely, taking the aduice of a Councell, or of men wiſe, learned, and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the matter which is to be determined, to the end he may not erre; they ſay not this, to ſignify, that the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his definition conſiſteth in, or proceedeth from the wiſdome, and learning of his Counſellors, but only to ſhew, that he is bound to proceed prudently, and maturely. And ſo likewiſe, when Valentia, and authors of the ſecond opinion ſay, that if the Pope ſhould define alone, without a Councell of Biſhops, or aduice of other learned men, he could not erre; they ſay it not to deny, that he is bound to vſe ſuch meanes, but to ſignify, that the infallibility of his definition conſiſteth not in them, but in his owne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and warrant which he hath from Chriſt of not erring. And this is the meaning of Valentia, as in that very place he expreſly declareth. Nor do I ſee, what you can find ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, either abſurd or vntrue.</p>
                  <p>But if you curiouſly demand: Whether the Pope may erre, in caſe he proceed to define inconſideratly and raſhly? Valentia, and all Catholike Doctors will anſweare, that your Queſtion implieth a Condition impoſſible: for the Pope in his definitions cannot proceed immaturely. The Philoſophers ſay, <hi>Qui dat formam, dat conſequentia ad formam: He that giues the forme, giues alſo the diſpoſitions neceſsary for the forme.</hi> And he that giueth the end, giueth alſo ſuch meanes as are neceſſary for the attaining of the end. Wherfore Chriſt hauing made promiſe to the See Apoſtolike, that <hi>the gates of hell shall not preuaile againſt her, and that the ſucceſſors of S Peter shall not faile in confirming their brethren,</hi> it belongeth to his diuine prouidence, ſo to direct, gouerne, and aſſiſt

                     </gap> of him you may proue the doctrine of them to be new. Yea, and concerning the very
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:181297:347"/>vſe of them, he proueth it to be moſt ancient, by the ſame arguments Roffenſis before him had done, concluding, that you, and all others which <hi>contemne a thing practiſed ſo many hundreds of yeares by the Catholike Church, and established by generall Councels, are iustly accounted heretikes.</hi> So farre is Caſtro from fauoring Luthers cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The third Author is Bellarmine, out of whom you cite theſe words<note n="(n)" place="margin">

And ſo alſo are the Engliſh, (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe you ſet downe in a different character as his) &amp; not only diſagree from the Latin, but containe falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine repugnant to all Catholike Diuines, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to Bellarmine, who in that very place<note n="(p)" place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg. c. <hi>2.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit. <hi>2.</hi>

You falſify, making Bellarmine to limit the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall treaſure of the Church to workes of ſupererogation only; which is ignorantly ſpoken, and not taught by Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, nor any Catholike Diuine. 4. You father on him falſly thoſe laſt words, <hi>Hoc</hi> (theſauro) <hi>caruiſſe dicunt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam Doctores Louanienſes:</hi> for they are not his, nor doth he attribute any ſuch doctrine to the Deuines of Louain, nor ſo much as once name them in all that Chapter. Is it not then great perfidiouſneſſe, ſo to abuſe and falſify both him, and them?</p>
                  <p>Nor is your dealing better with Suarez: for (to omit
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:181297:347"/>that in the place you cite, he treateth of no ſuch matter) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor Bellarmine euer ſay, that <hi>Duraud</hi> denied this treaſure of the Church, but only, that he held it to conſiſt of the ſatisfactions of Chriſt, and not of the Saints. Which yet he ſpeaketh by way of doubt, &amp; Theologicall diſpute, rather then affirmatiuely: for coming to deliuer his owne opinion, he ſayth plainly and reſolutely<note n="(q)" place="margin">4. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 20. <hi>q.</hi> 3.</note>: <hi>Eſt in Eccleſia &amp;c. There is in the Church a ſpirituall treaſure of the paſsion of Chriſt, and his Saints, who ſuffered farre greater torments, then their ſinnes deſerued: And therfore the Church out of this treaſure may communicate to one, or more, ſo much as may ſuffice to make ſatisfaction for their ſinnes, either in part, or in whole, according as the Church shall pleaſe to communicate this treaſure, more or leſſe, which is nothing els, but the ſufferings of Christ, and his Saints communicated to vs, to ſatisfy for our ſinnes. Wherfore indulgences auaile by way of payment, for ſo much, as by Christ, &amp; his Saints, the paine, to which we are lyable, is paied.</hi> But if he had held that the ſpirituall treaſure of the Church conſiſteth of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of Chriſt only, that would auaile you nothing: for he defendeth Indulgences, which you deny: and if he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in any thing, he errred not with obſtinacy, as you do, but ſubmitted all his workes to the correction of the holy Catholike Roman Church, as you haue read in Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but conceale it.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therfore, that the great cloud of witneſſes, which you haue brought to iuſtify Luthers doctrin againſt indulgences, is either of Heretikes, or of Catholikes in workes prohibited by the Church, or if not prohibited, abuſed and falſified by you.</p>

<pb n="754" facs="tcp:181297:350"/>abandoned them and abiuring their doctrine, eaſt himſelfe into the armes of his Catholike Mother the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church. And aſwell for the confuſion of heretikes, &amp; confirmation of Catholikes, as alſo to yeild vnto all men, a reaſon of his fayth, he vndertooke an immenſe labor (in which he ſpent 24. yeares) of reading the workes of all the ancient writers of the Greeke and Latin Church, and out of them, hath in two large Volumes (which he intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>(Theſaurus Catholicus)</hi> demonſtrated moſt exactly, that they were all of the beliefe of the now Roman Church, &amp; deteſted the contrary doctrine of Proteſtants, as hereticall; no leſſe then at this day the Roman Church doth. The like hath bene performed by the moſt eminent Cardinalls Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius, and Bellarmine, the one in his Annals; the other in his learned Volumes of Controuerſies. The like paines hath bene taken by Doctor Sanders in his <hi>Monarchia viſibilis,</hi> by <hi>Iacobus Gaulterius</hi> in his <hi>Tabula Chronographica,</hi> againſt the French Huguenots, and by Doctor Norrice in his <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote</hi> &amp; <hi>Appendix</hi> againſt Engliſh Proteſtants. The like haue other learned writers done out of the workes of diuers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers; in particular <hi>Theodorus Petretus,</hi> out of <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. S. Leo, S. Gregory, and S. Bernard; Ioannes Nopelius,</hi> out of <hi>S. Ambroſe; Cornelius Schultingus,</hi> out of <hi>S. Hierome;</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Torrenſis,</hi> out of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> intituling their workes the <hi>Confeſsions</hi> of thoſe Fathers, and conuincing clearely in them, that they were all Roman Catholikes, and in all points of the ſame beliefe we profeſſe at this day.</p>
                  <p>This it is which we ſo often require of Proteſtants, a Catalogue of learned men, who in all ages ſince Chriſt, haue agreed with them, and diſſented from vs in all thoſe <hi>Tenets,</hi> which they mantaine againſt the fayth of the now Roman Church. This the beſt learned Proteſtants knew they could not performe, and therfore were enforced to ſay (as you haue heard<note n="(m)" place="margin">See heere aboue ſect. <hi>3.</hi>
